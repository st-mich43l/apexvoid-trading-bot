# Changelog

All notable changes to ApexVoid Trading Bot are documented in this file.

The project deploys from `master` without tagged releases. Add new entries to
`Unreleased` in the same pull request as the code change, then move them into a
dated section after deployment.


## Unreleased

### Changed
- Manual `/algo` entries simplified from a 3-leg 70/20/10 Shallow/Mid/Deep
  ladder to a plain 2-leg 80/20 ladder (Shallow/Deep), matching the auto
  algo's own zone-scale entry shape. A separate, fixed-size risk leg
  (0.05 lots, or 0.02 below $1k live equity) now rests 10 pips from the
  stop, on the entry side — not a share of the sized ladder volume, so
  account size never grows it. If price nearly invalidates the setup
  before reversing, this leg still catches a much deeper/better fill
  than Shallow or Deep ever would; if it keeps going instead, the small
  fixed size caps the extra loss to roughly the cost of that one leg.
  If the whole group fills, the risk leg is simply the deepest/last leg
  and rides as the runner toward the final target like any other — the
  existing shallow-first target-booking walk
  (`ManualAlgoAllocateTargetPlansAcrossLegs`) already treats it that way
  with no special-casing needed. `GroupWorstCase` (the group's
  advertised max-loss risk figure) now sums each leg's own lots × its
  own distance to the shared stop instead of assuming every leg shares
  one flat stop distance, since the risk leg's distance is deliberately
  much smaller than the main ladder's.
- Technique strategies (FVG/OB/IFVG/CRT/supply_demand — "structural
  source: technique" on the card) no longer force a single-leg market
  fill regardless of their declared policy. Owner-reported: a wide
  demand-zone iFVG BUY filled at market near the top of its own 50-pip
  zone instead of scaling into it, producing a much wider effective
  stop than the zone's own low edge would have given. The single-leg-
  market restriction was a 2026-08-26 workaround for a GROUP RECOVERY
  REQUIRED false-positive (an SL'd leg's deal lookup returning Unknown
  while a sibling leg was still open) that `TradePlanRuntime`'s
  `ClassifyCloseReason`/`ExitBeyondProtectiveStop` has since fixed
  generally, not entry-type-specific — technique strategies now fall
  through to their own configured policy (limit + zone_scale for
  FVG/OB/IFVG/CRT/supply_demand), DCA-ing into the zone at
  progressively better prices when the zone is wide enough to qualify,
  falling back to a single `market_watch` entry (broker-side zone
  revalidation, not a blind immediate fill) when it isn't. Scalp
  strategies keep their own single-leg-market-only restriction
  unchanged — that one is about execution simplicity, not the fixed
  recovery bug.
- Auto algo (TradePlan V8) TP1 now closes the shallow (worse-priced) leg
  of a multi-leg entry completely before touching a deeper (better-
  priced) leg, instead of closing both pro-rata. Owner-reported: "when
  it hit TP1, it should trail to the deeper entry price like the manual
  algo, not trail to the shallow entry quickly." Pro-rata closing kept
  both legs' remaining volume in their original ratio after every
  target, so the group's weighted-fill breakeven reference stayed
  skewed toward the shallow leg even once TP1 booked. The breakeven
  reference is now recomputed from only the legs still actually open at
  that moment (`VolumePlanner.AllocateShallowFirstStepped`,
  `TradePlanRuntime.cs`) - once the shallow leg empties, the deeper
  leg's own better fill dominates, mirroring manual algo's
  `PlanGroupEconomicBreakeven`.

### Fixed
- Scalp volume silently re-inflated to 1.5× table lots despite PR #486's
  "scalp books the same flat equity-table lot as any other trade" fix.
  `risk_multiplier_for_tier`'s scalp branch still returned
  `range_max_risk_multiplier` (1.5) - inert under the OLD `risk` sizing
  mode (the C# executor's `RiskLots` path never read `RiskMultiplier`
  at all), but PR #486 switched scalp's default sizing_mode to
  `equity_table`, whose `EquityTableLots` path DOES read it -
  `tableLots × 1.5`. Now returns `1.0` unconditionally, matching every
  other equity-table-sized trade; the paired stop-envelope shrink that
  existed only to hold dollar risk flat against the inflated volume is
  now correctly a no-op too.

### Removed
- Stopped the automatic Market Map owner Telegram digest
  (`market_map_scan_loop`, previously spawned unconditionally at
  startup) — owner-reported it was still sending after the trading-
  decision purge stages. `/trade_map` (on-demand) is unaffected.
- Market Map as the data source for the scanner's primary actionability
  gate (Stage 4 of the owner-directed purge). `resolve_actionability`
  (called from `scanner.py`'s main per-cycle loop — the actual gate that
  decides which detected setups are actionable, not just TradePlan's own
  secondary re-check from Stage 3) now reads the scanner's own
  multi-timeframe-scored M15 zone data (`analysis.per_tf["M15"].zones`)
  instead of `market_map.actionable_entries`, via the `zone_opposing_entries`
  adapter shared with Stage 3's worker.py migration (now living in
  `structural_target_room.py`). Tier is derived with the same formula
  `build_map` itself uses (`"major" if htf and (fresh or score >=
  major_score) else "zone"`, keyed off the zone's own `score_reasons`/
  `touches`/`score`) so a genuinely major wall still hard-blocks exactly
  as before — this was caught and fixed after an initial version that
  always assigned "zone" tier silently dropped two real hard-block cases
  in `test_scanner_actionability.py`.
- `worker.py`'s remaining Market Map consumers: the overlap-thesis veto
  (`_resolve_overlap_thesis`), the confluence-claim resolver
  (`_resolve_match_confluence_claim_id`), and the map-self-contradiction
  telemetry counter (`_has_overlapping_zones`) all now read `htf_zones`
  instead of `market_map`/`cached_market_map`. The `market_map` parameter
  is gone from `_publish_trade_plan_v8` entirely, and the dead
  `_overlapping_zone_conflict_reason` (superseded by
  `_resolve_overlap_thesis`, never called outside its own tests) is
  deleted.
- `map_strategy.py`'s fully-dead nearest-actionable-zone selection tree
  (`evaluate_market_map_strategy`, `_select_reaction`/
  `_select_reaction_detailed`, `ActionableMapEntry`,
  `MarketMapStrategyDecision`, and their exclusive helpers) — its `.match`
  result was already confirmed dead in Stage 1; the selection function
  itself turned out to have zero production callers either. Deleted
  `tests/test_auto_map_strategy.py` (734 lines, 21 tests, all exercising
  only this dead tree) and the 4 tests in
  `test_map_reaction_range_retirement.py` that exercised it too.
  `_reaction_in_lookback`/`_touches`/`_rejects` (still used by `worker.py`'s
  overlap-thesis guard and `scale_context.py`) are untouched.
- Market Map as the data source for the entry-containment hard block
  (Stage 3 of the owner-directed purge — "these technique calculate swing
  right? so we can migrate to scanner, detector and clean").
  `evaluate_structural_target_room`'s `opposing_entry_overlap` /
  `opposing_entry_contained` / `opposing_major_no_room` reject reasons now
  read opposing structure from `htf_zones` (the same technique-native
  displacement/supply-demand zone scan `_opposing_barrier_decision`
  already used, computed fresh from OHLC frames every M1 cycle) instead of
  `cached_market_map.actionable_entries`. A new `_zone_opposing_entries`
  adapter in `worker.py` converts `Zone` objects into the minimal shape
  the room check duck-types on (`side`/`lo`/`hi`/`tier`/`tags`/
  `contains_price`), always tagged `"zone"` tier to match the treatment
  Market Map's own `"zone"` tier already got. `market_map` itself is not
  removed yet — it still feeds the unrelated confluence-claim resolution
  and demand/supply overlap-thesis veto, candidates for a later stage.
- Market Map's "major tier" opposing-wall room cap on the fixed_rr ladder
  (Stage 2 of the owner-directed purge). `_fixed_rr_adaptive_room_pips`
  and `_technique_swing_room_pips` are gone — the fixed_rr ladder is no
  longer capped by any external opposing-structure scan; it's sized
  entirely from the technique's own configured R-multiples. The prior
  design let the technique's own `structure_swing` widen a major-tier
  Market Map wall but never remove it, and defaulted to unconstrained
  room whenever no major wall existed — a widen-only mechanism has
  nothing left to widen once there's no wall to widen from, so this is a
  clean no-op removal, not a narrowing: the common case (no major wall)
  behaves identically; the rare "major wall present" case now also gets
  the full ladder instead of a capped one. Deleted
  `tests/test_fixed_rr_adaptive_room.py` (180 lines, 13 tests) — its
  entire subject no longer exists.
- Market Map's candidate-generation role in `worker.py` (Stage 1 of a
  broader owner-directed purge — "we work on technique zone not
  calculate opposing zone blindly"). `evaluate_market_map_strategy`'s
  `.match` has been confirmed dead in production (a prior cutover already
  stopped it promoting any zone to a trade candidate; zero occurrences of
  "Market Map" as a live strategy name in production funnel telemetry).
  The call, its telemetry write (`auto_trade:map_strategy:actionable:*`,
  never read back anywhere), the disabled `market_map_guard_enabled`
  variable (computed but never used), and the status-payload debug fields
  it fed are all removed. `structural_target_room.py`'s opposing-zone room
  check (the "major tier" wall, already being superseded by technique-
  native `structure_swing` math per #493/#494) and Market Map's own
  data-collection pipeline are untouched — later stages.

### Changed
- Auto-algo root card TP lines now show an R-multiple ("+1R", "+1.5R")
  instead of a raw pip count ("+21") — a bare pip figure reads as
  meaningless without the stop distance next to it, especially now that
  XAU's ladder is no longer uniformly 1R/2R across levels. Read straight
  from the instrument's own configured `target_r_multiples` rather than
  derived from the card's own stop/entry-zone prices — those don't share
  a basis (the stop is anchored to structure; the displayed entry-zone
  edge is only a reward-side planning reference), so a price-derived
  ratio could land far from the real R (live 2026-09-07: a GBPJPY SELL
  showed "+10R"/"+15.6R" for what was actually a uniform 1R/2R trade).
  Falls back to the previous pip-count display for non-fixed_rr matches
  or an unresolvable symbol.
- Manual `/algo` TP levels are now a bot-calculated R-multiple ladder
  (0.5R / 1R / 2R / 3R, four levels) instead of owner-typed prices or the
  pip-default ladder — owner-reported: hand-picked levels made some trades
  read as scalps. Any explicit `tp` the owner still types in algo mode is
  ignored; non-algo (`notify`) signals are unaffected. FX pairs' own
  `/algo` shorthand is a separate code path and is unaffected.
- Auto XAU (`xau_fixed_2r_v1`) now targets the same 0.5R/1R/2R/3R ladder as
  manual (`reward_risk` 2.0 → 3.0, `close_ratios` 0.5/0.5 → 0.4/0.2/0.2/0.2,
  `breakeven_after_r` 1.0 → 0.5 to follow the new, closer first target) and
  raises its structure `stop_envelope.min_pips` floor 25 → 50 (`max_pips`
  100 unchanged) — the old 25-pip floor let non-scalping structural setups
  take scalp-sized stops on an instrument that stop-hunts routinely; the
  owner's own manual XAU trades already run 60-100 pip stops through the
  same structure and hold. FX packs are unaffected; the per-policy
  `FIXED_RR_REQUIRED_TARGETING` uniformity check that previously forced
  every `fixed_rr` instrument onto one shared targeting shape is now keyed
  per policy so XAU can diverge from FX deliberately.

### Fixed
- Manual `/algo` stop trail stepped "two rungs behind" the just-booked
  target instead of one — owner-reported: an XAU BUY fully filled 3 legs
  of the ladder (TP1/TP2/TP3, up to +202 pips peak) but the stop only
  moved to TP1's price, leaving the entire TP2-to-TP3 gain unprotected.
  "Two behind" was only ever equivalent to "one behind" on the old 2-rung
  (1R/2R) ladder — TP2 has no rung two behind it, so that case was already
  special-cased to trail to TP1 (one behind). The ladder grew to 4 rungs
  (0.5R/1R/2R/3R) without updating the general step, so TP3 trailed all
  the way back to TP1 (skipping TP2 entirely) and TP4 trailed to TP2
  (skipping TP3). Now walks backward from the immediately preceding rung,
  falling further back only when that rung isn't resolvable for the
  specific leg (an adaptive/compressed plan can own a non-contiguous
  ordinal subset) — every rung now trails to the one right before it.
- `tp_booked`/`position_closed` events computed "Achieved: Npips" from the
  planned target price instead of the real close execution price, while
  the "Fill:" price shown right next to it on the same line was always the
  real one — live 2026-09-07, a USDJPY TP1 showed "Fill: 154.362" next to
  "Achieved: +10.0 pips", but 10.0 pips only reconciled against the
  154.357 *target*, not the 154.362 fill actually booked (off by 0.5
  pip). Now derives the pips from the same real execution price the Fill
  line displays; falls back to the planned target price only when no real
  exit price is available (broker-absent close reconciliation, where deal
  history itself is what's missing).
- Auto-algo root card Redis identity keys (`forming_message_key` /
  `telegram_root_message_key` / `forming_status_key`, and the canonical
  `analysis:setup:{setup_id}` record) had a 24h TTL floor that re-anchors
  from the last write, not from activation — a position that fills and
  then sees no further event for over a day (a normal weekend: fill
  Friday, market closed until Sunday night) had its mapping silently
  expire while still open. The next real event then found no card,
  posted a duplicate instead of threading onto the original, and
  orphaned the original permanently — confirmed live on a USDJPY
  position that crossed a weekend. Floors raised to 30 days on both
  sides.
- Trade-stats session breakdown (Asia/London/NY) now classifies each trade's
  hour in UTC instead of `delivery.presentation.seq_reset_tz`
  (Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh, UTC+7). `asia_start`/`london_start`/`ny_start` (22/7/13)
  are fixed UTC session-open hours; converting to ICT before comparing
  against them shifted every boundary by 7 hours, so ~83% of trades landed
  in the wrong session bucket (e.g. a real London-session trade at 08:00 UTC
  showed as ICT 15:00, which fell in the NY window). Affects the weekly
  recap, `/trade_stats`, and `/algo_status`'s scorecard — all three called
  `build_stats`/`build_stats_by_symbol` with the wrong timezone argument.
- XAU technique/reaction opposing-structure room check now uses a
  `barrier_buffer_atr` of 0.15 instead of the FX-tuned global 0.5
  (`instruments.XAU.overrides`). XAU's ATR is dollar-denominated, so the
  0.5x buffer was regularly consuming 40-115+ pips of real opposing-zone
  room — comparable to or larger than XAU's own 25-100 pip stop envelope —
  turning genuinely tradeable setups (owner's manual trades routinely run
  60-100 pip stops through the same structure) into false zero-room
  rejects before the fixed_rr ladder ever ran. FX instruments are
  unaffected; the original zero/negative-room hard-kill (2026-08-06,
  `fix/hard-kill-opposing-below-cost-room`) is unchanged.
- Manual algo now notifies and trails through middle TP levels omitted by a
  broker-volume ladder; reached-but-unbooked levels never create fake ledger
  profit or consume execution volume.
- Manual algo TP/partial-close channel cards drop the "booked X% · remaining
  Y%" figures — they described the whole group's cumulative fill, not the
  leg that just booked, and read as confusing/wrong next to the per-leg pips
  figure. Cards now just show the TP label and pips.
- Bound missing-position close reconciliation so delayed cTrader deal history
  cannot leave a filled manual ladder stuck open forever; after five minutes
  the last protective stop finalizes the state as an explicitly unconfirmed
  estimate, and a delayed history lookup for one position cannot block a
  second position from reconciling.
- Flip Zone now requires the shared key-level role authority to confirm a
  broken resistance/support for BUY/SELL, rejects unresolved or ambiguous
  anchors, and yields same-bar overlapping candidates to Key Level Reaction.
- XAU M1 Impulse Pullback now rejects unconfirmed trigger-bar extremes,
  weak displacement, non-corrective pullbacks, missing M5 references, broken
  level roles, and over-wide zones instead of manufacturing a key level from
  the trigger close. Structural stops are anchored to the selected M5 level
  or unmitigated demand/supply zone.
- Flip Zone now requires the configured consecutive breakout closes, rejects
  expired breaks, and anchors its entry band entirely on the valid side of the
  broken level. A body-width floor prevents degenerate zones; reject metrics
  expose acceptance, expiry, and anchor violations.
- Canonicalize strategy names through `app/autotrade/strategy_names.py`,
  including production HFS/manual aliases and unresolved-name telemetry.
- Retire the duplicate `Trend Pullback` detector while preserving historical
  resolution and in-flight management; demand/supply coverage remains on the
  enabled Supply Demand and Order Block technique publishers.

### Added
- Manual algo channel cards now declutter on close: every interim TP/
  reached/SL-move reply a signal accumulated during its life is deleted
  once it's fully closed, and the root card gets one summary reply instead
  — final pips plus the realized R, not a dozen scattered bubbles.
  AutoTradeEngine.cs now carries the booking leg's own `EntryPrice` on
  every take_profit/position_closed/group_result event; a multi-leg
  group's shallow/mid/deep clips fill at different prices, and both the
  reported pips and the R denominator are measured from the SAME leg that
  achieved them, not the advertised entry zone.

### Changed
- Auto-algo root card (TradePlan V8 publish/`ORDER ACTIVATED` header):
  renamed the "POSITION ACTIVATED" header to "ORDER ACTIVATED" (backward
  compatible — a card already live before this deploy is still recognized
  under the old wording); dropped the "→ Executor owns mechanical entry
  and risk enforcement." footer line; each TP now gets its own line
  instead of one ' · '-joined Targets line; and removed live price
  tracking entirely (`forming_price_track_loop`, the 5s Telegram-edit
  loop, and the "Price now (live)" line) — one more source of edit-flood
  competing with ORDER FILLED / status replies for Telegram rate limits,
  and not something the card needs to show.
- Scalp stop buffers now use true-range M1 ATR with a live-spread floor;
  M5 scalp structure is rebuilt on M5 cadence and persists compact levels,
  zones, M1 ATR, and discovery measurements for deterministic M1 decisions.
- `strategies.scalping.stop.maximum_pips`: 30 → 45. The 30-pip cap predated
  the M1-ATR stop buffer above and was never revisited after that buffer
  landed; a calm-session buffer alone now runs ~8 pips and a volatile one
  20-30+, leaving little to no room for the actual structural distance.
  `stop_exceeds_maximum` was the single largest scalp reject reason in prod
  (260 hits across all three archetypes vs 78 for every new PR-L7 semantic
  gate combined) — this was the dominant cause of low scalp throughput, not
  the new discovery-quality gates.
- `Break & Retest` and `Momentum Ride` now resolve to their registered
  `breakout_retest` and `momentum_continuation` families instead of
  `unknown`. See `docs/audits/PR-S-canonical-strategy-names.md`.

### Changed
- **XAU technique → structure fixed_rr:** Pack `xau_fixed_2r_v1` / policy
  `xau_fixed_2r_v1` — SL from structure inside a 25–100 pip envelope, TP at
  1R/1.5R/2R (25/25/50) like FX. M1 scalping unchanged via
  `technique_fixed_rr_targeting` (scalp stays 1:2/1:1 discovery). See
  `docs/runtime/multi-symbol-routing.md`.
- **MAD soft quality only:** Remove live MAD hard gate from ZoneWatch
  activation. `execution.technique.mad_hard_gate_enabled` defaults **false**
  (must stay off in prod). MAD informs entry quality / structure analysis:
  `accum` → Range Edge soft confluence; `manip` → reaction/liquidity soft
  confluence; detections stamp `mad_{phase}` when clear. `mad_hard_gate` /
  `would_gate` remain research/replay only. See `docs/scalping/MAD.md`.
- **Erase HFS product lane:** M1 engine is ``strategies.scalping`` (YAML still
  loads ``high_frequency_scalp``). Env ``SCALPING_*`` replaces ``HFS_*``
  (deprecated aliases kept). Funnel keys ``…:scalp:{archetype}``,
  ``structural_source=scalp``, ``execution.technique.scalp_require_killzone``.
  Legacy ``HFS *`` strategy labels remain accepted for open plans / history.
  Docs: ``TECHNIQUE_SCALP_REDEFINE.md``, ``SCALP_UNIFY_M1_M5.md``.

### Added
- ApexVoid **Breakout Retest** technique: M1 compression box (not M5 24-bar
  envelope), displacement break → rejection retest → hold, per-reason Redis
  ``scalp:metric:{SYM}:breakout:{reason}``, observe-only
  ``breakout_retest_continuation`` math stamp. See
  ``docs/scalping/OWN_BREAKOUT_TECHNIQUE.md``.
- Own scalp mechanism research track: design doc
  ``docs/scalping/OWN_SCALP_MECHANISM.md``; observe-only
  ``scalp_features`` + ``math_counterfactual`` stamps on all M1 discoveries;
  ``app.scalping.performance`` join (archetype × session × math_agree).
  **No hard gates** — live allow/block unchanged; gates deferred to data.

### Fixed
- Scalp **1:2** plans move SL to **BE after TP1** books (runner protected);
  previously HFS 1:2 left the original stop fixed for the full runner.
- Scalp **1:1** discoveries publish a single TP and book **full volume**
  at that target (``close_ratio=1.0``); **1:2** still splits 50/50 at 1R+2R.
- Session bootstrap owner DM shows an explicit ``Balance $…`` line (parsed
  from the ready event) and suppresses lone live-grant ⚠️ DMs during the
  same 6h cooldown window.
- Session bootstrap owner DM also absorbs startup ``warning`` events (e.g.
  live-account token grant) so restart no longer sends a separate ⚠️ message
  alongside Engine ready.
- Suppress repeat owner Telegram ``Engine ready`` / session bootstrap
  messages when cTrader reconnects — batch config/ready/capability into
  **one** DM per restart (6h cooldown).

### Removed
- **Momentum Chase Scalp** HFS archetype: discovery, ignition detector,
  ``HFS_MOMENTUM_CHASE_ENABLED`` config, and live funnel counter removed
  after production showed late chase fills with poor RR (4/4 recent live
  trades hit SL). Legacy display aliases kept for historical fill stats.

### Changed
- M1 scalp strategies drop the **HFS** display tag (`Range Sweep Scalp`,
  ``Impulse Pullback Scalp``, ``Breakout Retest Scalp``). Publish uses ``family=scalp`` /
  ``strategy_mode=scalp_m1``; legacy ``HFS *`` / ``hfs`` / ``hfs_scalp`` still
  accepted. Shared ``unified_context`` loads M1+M5 windows for the M1 loop.
  See ``docs/scalping/SCALP_UNIFY_M1_M5.md``.
- Single redefine of technique + HFS: MAD no longer ranks/gates scalping —
  only ``accum`` soft-favors **Range Edge Scalp**. HFS Impulse enabled by
  default without ``require_sweep_body``; momentum ignition default bars 2;
  stale armed HFS contexts prune from ``scalp:active``; scanner MAD refresh
  no longer crashes on DataFrame ``or``. See
  ``docs/scalping/TECHNIQUE_HFS_REDEFINE.md`` and ``docs/scalping/MAD.md``.

### Added
- MAD-2 observe-only replay expectancy: phase × session × strategy table and
  Range/Impulse baselines via ``app.scalping.mad_replay`` (stamped phase only;
  ``mad_hard_gate`` counterfactual; holdout never used for tuning). No live
  hard block. See ``docs/scalping/MAD.md``.
- Agent rules at ``.agents/AGENTS.md`` (CI hands-off, allowlisted smoke only).

### Fixed
- V8 ``market_with_limit_scale`` no longer raises ``GROUP RECOVERY REQUIRED
  unknown close on L1`` when L1 hits SL, the deal-list lookup returns
  Unknown, and L2 is still open. Live quote on/past the protective stop
  promotes the vanished leg to SL (booking the stop, not the wick) and keeps
  managing remaining legs. Ambiguous partial unknowns finalize as
  manual/external instead of freezing ``IsManagingStage``. Dig 2026-08-26
  HFS Range Sweep ``v8:a80bf164…``.

### Added
- MAD-1 continuous A/M/D feature scores and observe-only ``would_gate`` previews
  on ``mad:phase:*`` and ``scalp:last_math_shadow:*`` (``features``, ``would_gate``,
  ``measured.mad_gates``). No live hard block — teaches MAD-4 gates from demo.
  Building Asia (unsealed) labels ``accum`` up to 24 ATR range quality.
  See ``docs/scalping/MAD.md``.
- MAD-0+ shared live telemetry: Asia session high/low seal + phase classifier
  (``accum`` / ``manip`` / ``expand`` / ``unclear``) for **technique scanner and
  HFS**. Redis ``mad:phase:*`` / ``mad:asia_range:*``; soft affinity boosts
  range scalping on accumulation and impulse families on expand/manip.
  No hard allow/block change. See ``docs/scalping/MAD.md``.

### Fixed
- Allowlisted ``test_hfs_scalp_publishes_inside_opposing_structure`` fixture:
  structure swing / wick now fit the HFS room-synced stop envelope so CI
  no longer fails every PR on ``stop_exceeds_envelope_*`` (master was already
  red). Test intent unchanged — opposing HTF bypass only.

- HFS Impulse Pullback and Momentum Chase enabled for **London/NY killzones**.
  Asia still gets Range Sweep / Breakout Retest only (code excludes Impulse/
  Momentum from the Asia permit list).
- HFS math shadow records in **live** observe-only (Redis ``scalp:last_math_shadow:*``
  + per-opp ``measured.math_liquidity_sweep``). Does not change allow/block;
  ``ControlledLivePolicy.enabled`` stays false so ``would_execute`` remains false.
- HFS Asia session permitted again for enabled archetypes (Range Sweep /
  Breakout Retest). Killzone choke still applies outside Asia; rollover stays
  empty. Impulse/Momentum remain off via archetype flags. Owner: Asia still
  prints usable XAU momentum.
- HFS stop envelope: TradePlan now uses ``strategies.high_frequency_scalp.stop``
  (max **30** pips) for HFS strategies instead of the XAU reaction 40–60 band.
  Publish clamps ``structure_swing`` to the discovery stop and books a 1R/2R
  ladder from that stop. Dig 2026-08-25: Range Sweep ledger stops were 24–62
  while HFS max was ignored.
- HFS Breakout Retest: widen break scan (default 8 M1 bars), floor retest
  lookback at 4, and require only close-beyond-level for the hold (drop
  same-color body). Prod funnel had zero breakout_retest discoveries.
- GBPJPY Key Level Reaction quality (still enabled): require killzone,
  explicit support/resistance role, HTF alignment, grade A, and
  ``minimum_key_touches: 3`` via instrument overrides. Dig 2026-08-25
  showed Key Level alone was 0/4 (−118 pips); other setups were ~flat.
- USDJPY defended-level guard is direction-aware: hard-block **BUY** only
  within 30 pips of 160; **SELL** near the ceiling is allowed (aligned with
  intervention). The prior symmetric 100-pip band zeroed the book (0
  publishes / 110+ activations at ~159.4).
- Docs: refreshed ``docs/deployment.md`` for current compose boot order,
  local vs Ansible shapes, host dirs, manifest authority, multi-symbol
  smoke checks, and technique-pack defaults aligned with
  ``config/trading-bot.yml``.
- Docs: refreshed overview-linked pages for multi-symbol reality, added
  ``docs/README.md`` index, brought ``schema.sql`` / bot-commands in line with
  ``store.init_db`` (charts, auto-trade ledger, ``/trade_modify``). Completed
  P0/migration/phase ledgers moved under ``docs/history/`` and
  ``docs/configuration/history/``.
- Algo-bot INFO logs no longer heartbeat on expected wait/reject loops
  (outside killzone, cutover waiting, scanner card suppress, allowed
  structural-room dumps, idle scalp M1 cycles). Repeating killzone /
  hard-block notices throttle to once per 5 minutes; reaction funnel
  snapshots once per 15 minutes. Set ``LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG`` for full detail.
- TradePlan V8 now carries an explicit immediate `market` entry for a
  confirmed, in-budget HFS trade-direction chase. Ordinary in-zone market
  routes retain broker-side `market_watch` zone revalidation.
- Autonomous two-leg XAU and FX entries now allocate 80% to the
  shallow/live-proximal leg and 20% to the deep/distal limit leg. Manual algo
  entry sizing is unchanged.
- Autonomous FX now treats sweep/body confirmation as a preference after a
  fresh, directionally valid M1 trigger instead of a hard rejection. Fixed-RR
  plans still prefer the configured 2R partial ladder; when clean opposing
  room cannot hold 2R but can hold 1R, execution publishes one 1R target that
  closes 100% with no trailing. Room below 1R remains a terminal rejection.
- Manual ``/algo`` multi-leg ladders now reserve one broker-minimum shallow
  slice for the owner's final target. TP1 uses group-economic break-even,
  TP2 protects every surviving clip at the actual shallow entry, and TP3
  advances the runner to TP1. This applies whether only Shallow filled or
  Mid/Deep also filled; autonomous algo execution is unchanged.
- JPY reaction sessions now cover Japanese open through London morning
  (``tokyo_london`` → ``0-11`` UTC, ``tokyo_london_ny`` → ``0-11,13-16``).
  The prior ``0-3`` Tokyo slice left mid-Tokyo (03–07 UTC / JST afternoon)
  dead for GBPJPY/USDJPY, so those books looked London/NY-shaped despite
  local JPY liquidity. EURUSD/GBPUSD stay ``london_ny``.
- CRT technique entry now clips to a proximal reclaim band (same default
  width contract as FVG / ``price_scale.fvg_entry_max_width_price``) while
  keeping the full H1 candle as structural stop bounds. Discovery prefers
  closed H1 candles (``h1_lookback_bars``, default 3) instead of the forming
  bar. Live dig: full-H1 CRT zones hit ``zone_too_wide`` /
  ``stop_exceeds_envelope_furthest_leg`` and never published.

### Fixed
- HFS full-market chase plans no longer become `market_watch` orders against
  an abandoned structural zone. Production replays showed valid Range Sweep
  setups either failing stop validation or expiring unfilled while price
  continued through both targets.
- Autonomous terminal events no longer promote a merely touched/deferred TP
  into a booked TP when the position later closes at its stop. Broker lookup
  timeouts now classify a live fallback fill near the protective stop as SL,
  and Telegram/stats reject contradictory archived-TP loss events.
- ``/trade_modify XAU #N lo-hi`` now shifts SL by the signal's existing
  shallow-entry risk distance when no explicit SL is supplied. Broker cancel
  now removes every pending shallow/mid/deep leg, including old revisions,
  before one confirmation re-arms the modified ladder.
- Manual /algo SL accounting no longer journals the post-stop sweep when the
  broker deal window misses the fill. Live 2026-08-25 XAU ``#5`` (BUY
  4632–4635 / SL 4629) closed ``reason unconfirmed`` at live bid ``4622.08``
  and booked ``-109`` against a 60-pip stop. Unknown closes with no recovered
  deal price now promote to SL/TP and book the protective stop when the live
  quote sits on or beyond that stop.
- Bare-zone ``/trade_modify [SYMBOL] #N lo-hi`` also shifts TP levels by the
  same entry delta (preserving R-multiples). Live dig: SL auto-moved with the
  new zone while TPs stayed on the old ladder.
- ``/trade_modify [SYMBOL] #N lo-hi`` no longer hits Usage when only the
  entry zone changes. ``_seq_token`` required the whole remainder to be
  digits, so ``#14 4636-33`` never resolved the daily seq even though
  bare-zone body parsing (``#394``) was already correct. Seq now reads
  only the leading ``#N`` / ``N`` token; usage/help show the short forms.
- HFS / scalp chase entries no longer book a five-clip micro-grid into the
  abandoned zone. Live 2026-08-21 HFS Range Sweep SELL filled only L1
  (``0.04``) while L2–L5 rested above market and were cancelled ``before_tp``,
  leaving most of the intended size off the winning move. Trade-direction
  chase (SELL below zone / BUY above zone) now resolves to a full market
  order; in-zone scalps keep the equal-clip grid.
- FX Telegram root cards no longer collapse every price to two decimals
  (live 2026-08-21 GBPUSD showed ``1.36`` for price/zone/key/stop while the
  fill was ``1.36447``). Trade-area formatting, stop patches, and live Price
  now refresh use per-instrument digits; FX live ``min_move`` is one pip
  instead of the XAU ``0.5`` threshold that froze FX cards. Detector reason
  price notes also stop forcing ``.2f``.
- Autonomous FX ``fixed_rr`` reaction now stamps pack volume
  (``manual.risk_multiplier`` / ``fx_volume_multiplier``, default ``1.5``)
  onto ``effective_risk_multiplier`` so equity-table lots match manual /algo
  FX (e.g. ``0.12`` → ``0.18``). Live 2026-08-21 GBPJPY Key Level filled at
  raw ``0.12`` because auto ignored the pack scale. Stop envelopes stay at
  1× (volume-only boost); scalp keeps ``range_max`` without stacking 1.5×.
- V8 publish always releases thesis/zone claims on failure — catch
  ``TradePlanError`` and unexpected exceptions in ``_publish_trade_plan_v8``
  (and convert validate failures in the builder to ``TradePlanBuildRejected``).
  Live 2026-08-20: an uncaught ``SELL targets must all be below the entry zone``
  left ``analysis:active_thesis:XAU:1681edb5…`` orphaned and blocked later HFS
  with ``thesis_already_owned``.
- Same-direction stack sizing collapses multi-leg routes
  (including ``market_with_limit_scale``) to ``single_limit`` at the planned
  entry instead of ``market_watch`` over the full zone, so short HFS SELL
  targets stay on the correct side of the order price under a 60% stack add.
- HFS / range-scalp V8 execution eligibility now treats trade-direction chase
  within ``maximum_chase_pips`` as immediately executable (same contract as
  HFS activation), instead of parking chase quotes as
  ``waiting_retest_entry_zone``.
- XAU manual `/algo` ladders now retain one shallow-entry initial-risk
  contract across all shallow/mid/deep legs. Simultaneous broker-side closure
  reconciles the full group's volume-weighted realised pips instead of losing
  earlier sibling legs and reporting only the final deep leg.
- Added an incident-scoped, dry-run-first repair for manual signals #101/#104;
  corrected ledger rows carry a durable source marker so a generic Redis stats
  replay cannot restore the bad deep-leg result or per-fill stop distances.
- After manual-ladder TP1, booked profit now funds one shared group-economic
  stop for every remaining clip. The stop guarantees the configured positive
  whole-group buffer without bunching each leg at its own break-even; TP2
  advances filled multi-leg groups to the owner's absolute TP1, while the
  shallow-only runner follows the later progression documented above.
- Multi-symbol ZoneWatch processing no longer rebuilds the complete effective
  instrument/catalog projection for every OHLC price. Effective instrument
  contexts are cached per immutable runtime (with safe copy invalidation and
  ambiguity checks), removing the production hot path that pinned the bot at
  ~100% CPU and delayed owner commands by 72-79 seconds.
- ZoneWatch active membership now has backward-compatible per-symbol Redis
  indexes instead of loading and JSON-decoding every symbol's watch list on
  each quote. Active V6/V8 exposure payloads use batched ``MGET``, and
  ``/algo_status`` counts the maintained active-position set instead of
  scanning the full Redis keyspace.
- cTrader startup/periodic reconciliation now fetches one account snapshot
  and partitions it across every bound instrument. Manual/legacy FX fills are
  adopted and managed with their own symbol/pip/lot metadata; unknown symbols
  remain unmanaged instead of silently falling back to the XAU session.
- TradePlan submitted-leg reconciliation and open-position management share
  one fresh broker snapshot within an active symbol poll, while idle symbols
  do not request account snapshots. Snapshot reuse deliberately stops at the
  symbol boundary so a later symbol never observes pre-mutation broker state.
- Manual signals without an explicit setup tag always default to
  ``key-level`` (``/scalp`` or an explicit tag still win). SL/TP form does
  not leave trades untagged; candidate payload uses ``key-level`` instead
  of opaque ``Manual Algo``.
- HFS scalping's M1 cycle (``process_m1_bar``) called ``build_micro_structure``
  and ``discover_all`` (pandas/CPU-heavy) directly on the shared event loop —
  unlike ``_ensure_context`` right next to them, already correctly offloaded
  via ``asyncio.to_thread``. Fires on every M1 bar close for every HFS-enabled
  symbol (once a minute, all symbols' bars closing in sync); production logs
  showed individual cycles taking 14-38 seconds, a real, frequent contributor
  to the bot feeling slow to respond. Now offloaded the same way.
- ``get_current_market_map`` called ``build_map`` (pandas/CPU-heavy)
  synchronously inline instead of via ``asyncio.to_thread``, unlike the
  scanner's own hot path which already offloads the same function after a
  documented prod incident (2026-08-12: inline calls blocked Telegram
  handling for 5-6s). This call site is reached every 60s by the market-map
  scan loop and directly by the ``/trade_map`` command, both on the one
  shared event loop — now offloaded the same way.
- The hourly owner Market Map digest only posted when the map was judged
  materially changed, but marked the hour's bucket done either way — on a
  quiet market it could go silent for multiple consecutive hours instead of
  reliably delivering once an hour. Now posts once per bucket unconditionally.

### Changed
- XAU manual `/algo` books 40% of group volume at TP1 by default. Manual entry
  mode, algo capability, shallow risk reference, size multiplier, and TP1
  fraction are now explicit per-instrument configuration rather than inferred
  from autonomous target mode.
- Closed bars now use one ordered worker/OHLC cache per symbol, allowing
  different instruments to progress concurrently without corrupting shared
  cache state. Spot ZoneWatch wakes similarly run once per symbol and
  coalesce obsolete intermediate notifications because evaluation reads the
  latest Redis quote.
- ``entry activation waiting outside_reaction_publish_window`` (zone-watch
  spot-tick re-evaluation) is logged at DEBUG instead of INFO. The spot loop
  re-checks every still-pending zone-watch record on every tick
  (``spot_min_interval_s=3.00``), and the reaction-publish window can stay
  closed for hours outside session hours — this one line alone was 97.9% of
  a full day's production log (109,821 of 112,212 lines, 2026-08-20),
  drowning out everything else. The decision is still recorded via
  ``_record_policy_telemetry`` regardless of log level, so no observability
  is lost.
- FX instrument declarations in ``config/trading-bot.yml`` now use the
  ``instrument_packs`` mechanism (already implemented, previously unused —
  every live pair was a full ~65-line block instead of a `pack:` reference).
  EURUSD/GBPUSD declare ``pack: fx_usd_major_v1``; GBPJPY/USDJPY declare a
  new ``fx_jpy_cross_v1`` pack (shared pip/digits/price-scale/targeting
  scaffolding, `stop_envelope`/`policy`/`analysis.zones`/`close_ratios`
  stay per-pair since they genuinely differ). Each pair now declares only
  broker/canonical symbol plus its real deltas from the pack — adding a
  new USD-major or JPY-cross pair no longer means copying and hand-editing
  a 65-line block. Purely structural: verified the fully-expanded/merged
  config is byte-identical to the pre-refactor YAML for every instrument.
- Manual /algo execution now runs one dedicated asyncio worker per live symbol
  (intent bridge + event reconcile dispatch into per-symbol queues) so many FX
  pairs stay current without one symbol blocking another.
- FX manual /algo channel cards show **Entry Price** (single entry-at level) instead
  of **Entry Zone** — FX uses entry-at, not XAU-style zones.
- XAU manual /algo ladders book the group TP ladder preferring **shallow**
  volume first (most likely to fill, largest leg), then mid, then deep —
  deep only contributes once shallow/mid capacity is exhausted for a
  slice. Reversed from an earlier deep-first design: deep-first assigned
  the group's closest ordinals (TP1/TP2) to the smallest, least-likely-
  to-fill leg, so if deep (and often mid) never filled at all, no order
  ever existed to hit TP1/TP2 — they silently never appeared on the
  channel even after shallow itself had already booked real profit under
  a later ordinal's label. Shallow now owns the close targets it can
  reliably reach; deep rides as the runner toward the final target.

### Fixed
- Owner Market Map digest no longer deletes and resends an outwardly
  identical card every scan tick. ``map_materially_changed`` grouped
  entries/rails by their **full** internal tag list, but the rendered card
  only ever shows the top few tags by priority (``_compact_tags``/
  ``_compact_rail_tags``) — a low-priority tag like "price inside" (lowest
  ``_tag_priority``) flips on/off as live price crosses a zone edge without
  ever reaching the visible card, so the scan loop treated that invisible
  flip as a material change and spammed the owner DM with a "new" message
  that read the same as the last one. Change detection now compares the
  same tag selection that actually gets rendered.
- Manual /algo **close** channel cards no longer report a lower pip count
  than the highest TP already booked (e.g. TP4 +160 then closed +130) —
  ``finalize_manual_group`` and ``group_result`` handling keep the peak
  reached across booked legs / runner telemetry, not the last leg's blend.
- Manual /algo TP channel posts no longer crash with ``NameError: _win_wings``
  after #371 — restore the helper accidentally dropped from ``trade_ops.py``.
- Manual /algo TP book pip math now uses the **booking leg's own** actual
  entry-to-exit distance (``leg_realized_pips``, already computed correctly
  per leg by AutoTradeEngine.cs), not a shared "deepest filled" reference
  blended across the whole group — a leg's own TP hit now reports that
  leg's own real pips, not another leg's.
- After TP1, remaining XAU ladder legs still publish ``stop_moved`` even when
  shallow-first volume fully closes the shallow clip. The current policy now
  uses the group-economic protected stop documented above rather than a
  separate fill-level BE for each leg.
- Manual /algo BE/TP channel updates still acquire when a lifecycle event
  omits ``symbol`` or ``position_id`` — route by ``candidate_id`` / intent.
- Manual-algo / FX CI tests no longer assume a single limit order or brittle
  TP-slice comment strings after the XAU ladder redesign — smoke checks verify
  placement; multi-leg cases opt in with ``manualSingleEntry: false``.
- XAU manual /algo ladder fills no longer spam the channel with one TP/SL
  update per entry leg — progress is booked and posted from the furthest
  signal-level TP/SL only (trailing legs at the same level are ignored).
- Manual /algo ``manual_limit_placed`` no longer posts a
  "⏳ limit placed — waiting for fill" channel card. A multi-leg entry
  (shallow/mid/deep) publishes one of these events per leg with no dedup,
  so the channel got the identical card 2-3x per signal. The owner-only DM
  (off by default) still records it; the real "🟢 active" card on fill
  already tells the channel the position is live.
- Telegram ``CHANNELS`` / ``SYMBOLS`` routing rebuilds from
  ``live_instruments()`` on each access instead of freezing at process import,
  so a newly live pair routes channel fan-out after config reload/restart without
  a stale map missing the symbol.
- XAU manual /algo now cancels unfilled shallow/mid/deep entry clips as soon
  as any TP books (``unfilled_leg_after_tp_policy=cancel``). Hitting TP1 no
  longer leaves the rest of the entry ladder working on the broker.
- FX owner manual ``/algo`` uses a single entry-at price (no entry zone) and
  defaults the setup tag to ``key-level`` the same way XAU short-form DMs do.
- FX owner manual ``/algo`` parsing no longer crashes on
  ``EffectiveInstrumentConfig.stop_envelope``; default protective stops now
  read ``execution.reaction.stop_min_pips`` / ``stop_max_pips`` like the rest
  of the FX execution stack.
- XAU owner manual DMs accept a single price (``xau buy 4078 / algo``) as
  well as the existing entry-zone shorthand (``4078-75``).

### Added
- Owner `/trade [SYMBOL] BUY|SELL …` command: lists configured live manual
  books when called without a signal, resolves configured broker aliases, and
  submits through the same parse/news-guard/store/broadcast/algo path as the
  legacy free-text DM.
- Safe symbol-onboarding contract: reusable instrument packs reject identity
  and rollout fields, every packed instrument must declare rollout explicitly,
  and the resolved manifest carries each instrument's manual execution profile.
- ``instrument_packs`` top-level CONFIG_FILE section: declare reusable FX packs
  (e.g. ``fx_usd_major_v1``) and go live a pair with ``pack: …`` plus
  ``broker_symbol`` / ``contract`` / ``analysis.zones`` overrides only.
- ``manual_algo.sizing.fx_volume_multiplier`` (default ``1.5``): manual /algo FX
  candidates stamp ``risk_multiplier`` and ctrader-engine scales equity-table
  lots before placing the limit order.
- Owner FX manual /algo DMs: ``eurusd buy 1.15007 / algo`` (and GBPJPY,
  USDJPY) auto-fill a 1:2 protective stop from each pair's stop envelope,
  a 1R/1.5R/2R partial-exit ladder with policy close ratios, and a single
  resting entry — BE at 1R and trail to 1R after 1.5R match autonomous
  ``fx_fixed_2r_v1`` management on the V6 manual-algo executor.
- ``/trade_stats`` without a ``SYMBOL`` argument now shows a per-symbol
  net/win-rate overview (XAU, EURUSD, GBPJPY, …) above the combined books.

- USDJPY joins EURUSD and GBPJPY as demo-live: `fx_fixed_2r_v1` policy, own
  pip/lot/zone geometry (pip 0.01, pip value ~6.27/lot at current spot), and
  a Tokyo+London+NY reaction-publish window (`0-3,7-11,13-16` UTC) reflecting
  its liquidity across all three sessions as a USD/JPY major.
- GBPUSD joins EURUSD and GBPJPY as demo-live: `fx_fixed_2r_v1` policy, a
  London+NY reaction window (`london_ny`), and EURUSD stop-envelope geometry
  (10–18 pip protective stop) with matching FX price-unit geometry.
- Per-symbol position-management mechanisms, grounded in each pair's real
  2026 behavior:
  - USDJPY: a defended-level guard hard-blocks new entries within a
    configurable price buffer of a macro-significant level. Japan/the US
    ran a record ~¥11.73T joint intervention specifically when USDJPY
    breached 160 (dollar snapped 163→~156-157, a 600+ pip reversal); with
    spot sitting at ~159.47 when this shipped, USDJPY is configured with
    `defended_levels: '160'` and a 100-pip buffer.
  - GBPJPY: a new `fx_fixed_2r_frontload_v1` policy front-loads partial
    exits (40%/25%/35% vs the standard 25%/25%/50%) — same 1R/1.5R/2R
    ladder, more of the win locked in at 1R before a violent snap-back can
    give it back (ATR(14) ~180 pips/day vs EURUSD's ~70). Also gains an
    event-cluster news guard: when both GBP and JPY have a high-impact
    calendar event within 48h ("volatility clusters" — a BoE print and a
    BoJ statement compound rather than add), the news guard widens from
    the normal 30-minute single-event window to 3 hours around whichever
    event is nearer. Off by default (`event_cluster_guard_enabled`);
    currently only turned on for GBPJPY.

### Fixed
- V8 trade plans no longer enter `recovery_required` when every leg vanishes
  from the broker with an `Unknown` close reason and no deal fill price — the
  common pattern after an owner manual close on cTrader when the short deal
  window misses the exit. The runtime now finalizes with the live executable
  quote (bid for longs, ask for shorts), matching V6 manual-close handling.
  Live-quote selection compares `plan.Analysis.Direction` as `"BUY"`/`"SELL"`
  (the V8 contract string), not the `TradeDirection` enum — that type mismatch
  is what blocked PR #359's ctrader-engine image from compiling.
- Fix ``IndentationError`` in ``format_stats`` (PR #360) that crash-looped the
  trading bot on startup, taking down owner DMs, manual ``/algo`` arming, and
  all Telegram command handlers.

### Changed
- Price-action, Market Map, mapped-zone, range/trend, and HFS paths now consume
  one effective instrument runtime view. Pip floors, price identities,
  liquidity tolerances, trigger buffers, and M1 precision are derived from the
  active symbol instead of inheriting XAU's `0.1` pip and two-decimal geometry.
- EURUSD and GBPJPY now use the explicit ``fx_fixed_2r_v1`` execution policy:
  partial exits of 25% at 1R and 25% at 1.5R, then the remaining 50% at 2R,
  calculated from the final planned entry and protective stop. TP1 enables
  protected break-even; booking 1.5R trails the runner to 1R. FX no longer
  inherits XAU's absolute pip ladder; XAU and equity-table sizing are unchanged.
- FX technique and scalp entries use a two-clip micro-grid (market + one deeper
  limit) instead of XAU's five equal legs, configured via ``targeting.entry_clips``.
- V8 trade plans now finalize and report win/loss when the owner closes a
  position directly on the broker. Manual/external closes publish
  ``position_closed`` with the broker execution price and signed pips instead
  of stalling in ``recovery_required`` or misclassifying near-stop exits as SL.
- Algo-auto (V6) tracked positions do the same: a broker-side close reports
  signed pips from the recovered deal fill or live quote, not from the
  protective stop, and Telegram no longer invents an SL loss from ``stop_pips``.

### Fixed
- After TP1 moves the stop to break-even, a broker BE fill that cTrader
  omits from the short deal/order window now closes the plan as
  ``position_closed`` (highest TP archived) instead of
  ``GROUP RECOVERY REQUIRED unknown close``.
- EURUSD Market Map no longer rounds prices such as `1.08543` to whole numbers
  or applies XAU's map radii/change threshold. FX map bands, fallback levels,
  scalp rails, mapped-zone minimum widths, and material-change detection now
  use per-instrument price units; GBPJPY receives the same three-digit-safe path.
- FX fill, route, TP, close, and trailing-stop cards now retain the instrument's
  configured price digits. Full-TP prices use the event symbol's pip size rather
  than adding XAU's `0.1` pip to EURUSD or GBPJPY entries.
- FX PA no longer creates false confluence from absolute `0.1` liquidity and
  retest tolerances, collapses distinct zones/context IDs at two decimals, or
  evaluates HFS with the global XAU runtime policy.
- The same-wall overlap exemption is now limited to technique/confluence
  setups. Key-level and unfitted range entries contained in opposing structure
  are hard-blocked again instead of slipping through the final V8 gate.
- Legacy XAU policy evaluation no longer crashes while reading instrument-only
  `targeting.entry_clips`; it retains the five-clip default, while FX resolves
  its configured two-clip route at the instrument's own price precision.
- V8 close-reason classification no longer promotes an ambiguous vanish to
  stop-loss by comparing the exit to ``CurrentStop`` when no deal execution
  price was recovered (the same tautology V6 already fixed).
- Algo-auto missing-position P&L no longer falls back to ``CurrentStopLoss``
  for manual or unconfirmed closes, which made winning platform closes look
  like stop-outs.

- Private FX scalp/trend candidates now carry their canonical symbol through
  policy evaluation, preventing silent fallback to XAU stop and target
  geometry.
- V8 plans stamp ``risk.max_volume`` from each instrument's ``max_lots ×
  volume_units_per_lot`` (XAU 100_000, EURUSD/GBPJPY 100_000_000). The
  gold 100_000 cap on GBPJPY was 0.01 lots and rejected the 17 Aug HFS
  Range Sweep before submit (``equity_table_above_broker_maximum``).
- Mapped thesis rearm no longer crashes every M1 tick: picking the OHLC
  frame no longer bool-coerces a pandas DataFrame (``frames.get("M1") or …``).
- Close / reject / expire leave the autotrade root card intact (no
  ``TERMINAL`` rewrite) and drop it from the live Price-now index so a
  still-WAITING-FILL body cannot keep editing after the trade is dead.
- Setup-card publish test expects status-only edits when direction/strategy
  already match; wrong-direction forming bodies still get a full rewrite
  (regression coverage for the #333 terminal/card refresh path).
- ``/trade_delete`` on a still-pending algo-manual limit cancels the broker
  order first, then hard-deletes the row/posts on confirm (``🗑 deleted``).
  That is not ``/trade_cancel`` — cancel leaves a cancelled lifecycle card.
  Hard-delete also clears ``manual_algo_charts`` so FK rows cannot block it.

### Added
- EURUSD and GBPJPY go **live on the demo account** (same VIP/public Telegram
  channels as XAU). Pip/lot geometry is per instrument: EURUSD pip 0.0001 /
  100k / pip-value 10; GBPJPY pip 0.01 / 100k / pip-value **7** (JPY quote).
  Equity-table lots still apply; broker volume uses each symbol's `LotSize`.
  Zone merge/round/FVG widths are FX price units, not XAU dollars. Live
  resolve failures still fail closed (whole feed). Confirm broker symbol
  names (`EURUSD` / `GBPJPY`) on first deploy.
- Autotrade Fibonacci + ATR-normalized velocity/acceleration math: swing Fib
  ladders soft-boost confluence (`fib_touch`), dealing-range
  deep_discount/deep_premium at 0.382/0.618, HFS impulse preferred band
  0.382–0.618, and a Telegram **Math** line (`fib` / `v` / `a` / `PD`) on
  forming cards. Momentum Ride hard VA gate stays off unless
  ``MOMENTUM_VA_GATE_ENABLED=true``.
- Owner ``/trade_modify [SYMBOL] #N entry lo-hi sl X tp a/b/c`` (VIP
  ``modify #N …``) rewrites levels on an **unfilled** signal, deletes the
  old VIP/public cards, and posts a fresh entry message with the same
  ``#N``. Resting algo limits cancel first, then re-arm with a bumped
  intent revision on broker confirm.

### Changed
- ``/trade_stats`` (and the weekly recap) show AUTO TRADE and ALGO MANUAL
  as separate books with their own net, winrate, and setup lines. Combined
  unique is a footer only when both books have trades.

### Fixed
- HFS concurrent risk no longer sticks after multi-clip fills. Clip
  ``order_filled`` events count once per group, and each M1 cycle drops
  ghost ``open_positions`` when the broker/plan book is empty.

### Fixed
- Autotrade Integrity stays aligned with live close-card edits and
  broker-recovery metric snapshots. Leftover Range Edge opposing-containment
  pytest is deselected with the other retired V7 opposing fixtures.

### Changed
- Technique and Confluence Zone orders use the same five-clip scalp
  micro-grid as HFS (equal clips into the structural zone). Key Level
  reaction stays single-market. Momentum-chase HFS stays off unless
  `HFS_MOMENTUM_CHASE_ENABLED` is set. Dead private-trend worker intents
  are no longer built.

### Changed
- Spot-loop ZoneWatch reuses one OHLC window cache per eval so several
  active zones do not each ZRANGE M1/M5.

### Changed
- Closed-bar dispatcher no longer prefetches H1/M15/M5 on every M1. ZoneWatch
  and HFS fill the shared cache on demand. M5 still prefetches M1/M5/M15/H1
  for scanner.

### Changed
- Idle M1 worker ticks load leftover StrategyMatch first. With none, they
  rearm on M1 only and write a thin `last_gate` (`idle_no_match`) without
  private-gate, market-map, regime, or trend pandas. Scanner/ZoneWatch
  technique analysis is unchanged. A leftover match still runs the full
  worker publish path.

### Changed
- Idle M1 worker ticks skip leftover StrategyMatch routing and TradePlan V8
  publish when Redis has no match. Rearm, private-gate telemetry, and
  last_gate snapshots still run. Scanner-routed matches still publish.

### Changed
- Closed-bar dispatcher prefetches M1/M5/M15/H1 once and reuses those Redis
  windows for ZoneWatch, HFS, scanner, and worker. ZoneWatch still runs
  first so full HTF prefetch cannot delay activation; M1/M5 loads during
  activation populate the same cache.

### Changed
- Closed-bar dispatcher runs ZoneWatch M1 and HFS before scanner/worker so
  activation is not blocked behind detector analysis.

### Changed
- Closed-bar handling uses one `bars:new` dispatcher (scanner, worker,
  ZoneWatch M1, HFS) instead of four Redis subscriptions. ZoneWatch still
  listens to `spots:new` for in-zone activation.

### Changed
- Owner Telegram I/O runs through one priority actor (fill/root before
  Price-now). Forming-card live price updates every 5s (0.5 min move) and is
  dropped while flood-paused. ZoneWatch still throttles spots to 3s except the
  first tick inside a cached zone. Close-reason DealList lookup is 2s and does
  not retry unbounded on timeout. A flood-limited event retries once (5s) then
  the stream cursor advances instead of stalling 60s.

### Changed
- Docs refreshed to the current multi-service stack: README and
  `docs/architecture.md` describe algo-bot + ctrader-engine + Postgres +
  Redis + ZoneWatch → TradePlan V8; operations/deployment/bot-commands no
  longer document SQLite as the store. Added
  `docs/technique-zonewatch-publish.md` for technique/Confluence activation
  (chase, closed-bar invalidate, opposing overlap, location extremes).
- Scalp equity-table sizing: when account equity is below `$2,000`, a stamped
  scalp `risk_multiplier` above `1` now books **1.5×** table lots (e.g. `0.10`
  → `0.15`) instead of doubling. Reaction (`1.0`) sizing is unchanged; equity
  at/above `$2,000` still applies the stamped scalp boost.

### Fixed
- Root Telegram card stays in sync with the live order: fill rewrites
  `IN ZONE · WAITING FILL` before the manage reply; expire/reject/cancel and
  close change the head to TERMINAL and drop Price-now tracking. If publish
  never posted a root, fill/close recover one from the TradePlan match or
  from the lifecycle event itself (no 2s standalone gap).

### Fixed
- Technique / Confluence ZoneWatches can activate and publish: non-zero chase
  budget, closed-bar-only decisive break, activate remain/reject logs,
  `STRUCTURAL_SETUPS` membership, overlapping map opposing filter, and
  extreme location allowance for techniques (merged via #303).

### Fixed
- Reaction publish no longer treats a Market Map band glued to the live/
  planned price as opposing structure ahead (`raw_room≈0` /
  `opposing_barrier_room_below_cost`). Shared-boundary filter now also
  matches the planned entry; true interior barriers (fe023) still hard-block.
- Cut Redis SCAN thrash that was saturating the bot event loop: zone watches
  list via a membership index (`SMEMBERS`) instead of keyspace SCAN, regime
  alert delivery probes configured symbols with a 30s throttle, and spot-driven
  zone re-eval is capped at 2s.
- Forming-card create no longer indexes `message_id=0` placeholders into the
  live price-track set, so Telegram is never asked to edit a reserved id during
  the send round-trip.
- Scanner observations without a canonical executable match no longer reserve
  the four-hour Telegram band dedup and suppress the forming card when that
  same structure later becomes executable.
- `/trade_stats` now ingests autonomous and manual Algo results through an
  independent durable cursor and backfills retained executor events at
  startup, instead of depending on the owner Telegram delivery cursor.
- Broker-confirmed `/trade_cancel` results now reply to every persisted VIP
  and public signal post; manual Algo request/override acknowledgements no
  longer show redundant waiting/awaiting text.
- TradePlan V7 TP and close events now carry and display the achieved pip count,
  and stats preserve the highest archived TP rather than understating a trade
  after its residual exits at BE or SL.
- Serialized cTrader access-token reads with account-list/account-auth requests,
  preventing startup health checks from queuing a stale token while proactive
  refresh rotates it and then failing auto-trade with
  `CH_ACCESS_TOKEN_INVALID`; transient auto-trade session faults now retry
  inside the still-healthy feed session instead of leaving execution stopped.

### Added
- Authority-neutral grouped `runtime_config` reads for all 140 eligible
  analysis, strategy, actionability, and lifecycle production call-sites.
  Generated Phase 2F inventory and AST guards enforce zero remaining or
  dynamic legacy reads, while process-isolated parity covers exact values,
  types, truthiness, and representative decision snapshots under both legacy
  and canonical authority. Trading behavior, ENV/Compose, execution, risk,
  contract, C#, and the default `legacy` authority remain unchanged.
- Authority-neutral grouped `runtime_config` reads for bootstrap, logging,
  Telegram/delivery, calendar, weekly reports, watcher, and OHLC consumers.
  Legacy authority now exposes an immutable legacy-backed canonical view while
  canonical authority exposes the validated Python model; generated AST and
  reverse-map guards prove all 127 eligible reads migrated with value/type
  parity, while the default remains `legacy` and rollback remains independent
  of canonical loading.
- Selectable canonical Python configuration authority behind the restart-only
  `APEXVOID_CONFIG_AUTHORITY` loader control. The default remains `legacy`;
  explicit `canonical` validates a frozen 387-leaf Python/shared projection,
  exposes the existing 316-field/four-property facade, excludes 50
  cTrader-only fields, fails closed, emits secret-safe startup diagnostics,
  and supports deterministic restart rollback.
- Non-authoritative Phase 2D1 configuration activation rehearsal: an
  AST-backed legacy `Settings` usage inventory, generated immutable Python
  access map, read-only 316-field/four-property canonical facade, local-only
  authority and rollback models, explicit readiness blockers, secret-safe
  diagnostics, and reproducible Python/.NET verification commands. Legacy
  `Settings` remains authoritative and no production consumer is migrated.
- Non-authoritative Phase 2C configuration shadow loading: immutable
  `conservative`/`demo_eval` profiles, deterministic source precedence,
  per-layer alias conflict detection, field provenance, legacy compatibility
  rules, four-fixture 316/316 parity checks, redacted diagnostics, and an
  offline shadow CLI. Legacy `Settings` remains the only active runtime loader.
- Source-generated System.Text.Json metadata and a production-path startup
  contract self-test for TradePlan V7, plus durable C# executor
  acknowledgements and per-stream rejection records.
- Durable Scanner -> Worker handoff on Redis Stream
  `auto_trade:strategy_match_ready` (schema v1, `algo-worker` consumer group)
  with duplicate suppression, pending-entry recovery, canonical
  `StrategyMatch` reload, startup reconciliation, and no-op acknowledgement
  for terminal or already-published setups.
- Typed scanner `ExecutionEligibility` contract. Invalid geometry, opposing
  target room, ambiguous cross-side structure, key-role mismatch, broken
  support/resistance routing, disabled counter-bias, tier C, and provisional
  R/R failures remain auditable analysis-only observations but cannot create
  an executable match, setup lifecycle, or queued card.
- Truthful one-card lifecycle snapshots: `QUEUED`, `PREFLIGHT`,
  `WAITING RETEST`, and `PLAN PUBLISHED`, including ready-event, scanner, and
  worker timestamps plus quote/zone evidence in route telemetry.
- Restart-safe reaction execution state at
  `auto_trade:execution_confirmation:{setup_id}`, including deterministic
  retest episode ids, side-aware zone evidence, consumed M1 timestamps and a
  bounded two-bar retest-trigger validity window.
- TradePlan V7 contract (`contracts/autotrade/trade-plan-v7.json`, Python
  `app/autotrade/trade_plan.py`, C# `TradePlanV7.cs`): a single absolute stop
  and a concrete entry instruction (market_watch/single_limit/limit_ladder)
  declared entirely by Python, replacing the V6 `Planned*`/`stop_adjustment*`
  field family that let both services compute a stop and compare. See
  `docs/adr-trade-plan-v7-boundary.md`.
- `AUTO_TRADE_CONTRACT_MODE` (`legacy_v6` default / `shadow_v7` /
  `v7_primary` / `v7_only`) as a new fatal field in the existing Python<->C#
  config-health handshake, alongside `trade_plan_version` and
  `trade_plan_stream`.
- `execution:trade_plans` Redis stream and `execution:plan:{plan_id}` /
  `execution:plan_state:{plan_id}` keys, isolated from `auto_trade:*`.
- Python setup lifecycle state machine (`app/autotrade/setup_lifecycle.py`,
  `analysis:setup:{setup_id}`) and a `TradePlan` builder from an
  already-confirmed `StrategyMatch` (`app/autotrade/trade_plan_builder.py`).
- C# `TradePlanExecutionEngine` (mechanical entry/volume/target/break-even
  decision logic only, not yet wired to broker order submission) plus a
  dependency-boundary test suite proving it never references
  `StructureStopPlanner`, `ResolveExecutionRoute`, or the other legacy
  dual-planning symbols.
- No behavior change from any of the above by default (`AUTO_TRADE_CONTRACT_MODE`
  defaults to `legacy_v6` everywhere); V7 is not yet published, consumed, or
  used to place any order.
- `AUTO_TRADE_POSITION_MISSING_CONFIRMATIONS` (default `2`) and
  `AUTO_TRADE_POSITION_MISSING_RECHECK_SECONDS` (default `3`): a tracked
  position missing from one broker reconcile snapshot is only "suspected"
  missing and stays fully tracked until independently confirmed absent
  across this many time-separated snapshots.
- Confluence-merge zone (`app/analysis/confluence_zone.py`): co-located/
  nearby key level, demand/supply, order block, FVG and breaker structures
  (overlapping, or gap `<= zone_merge_gap`, default `1.0`) collapse into one
  `ConfluenceZone` capped at `zone_merge_max_width` (default `6.0` price
  units) carrying the union of their tags and a stable id (bucketed
  mid/width + sorted tags, mirroring `structural_zone_id`'s scheme). Same
  directional role only - a demand and a supply at the same price never
  merge. `resolve_confluence_zone_id`/`claim_confluence_zone` key a new,
  independent SETNX claim on the merged zone + direction so a second
  strategy resolving onto an already-claimed zone is rejected
  (`zone_already_claimed`) rather than producing a second plan; wired into
  `worker.py::_publish_trade_plan_v7` alongside the existing thesis claim.
- `m1_trigger` (`app/analysis/m1_trigger.py`) supplies optional timing evidence
  for a setup already confirmed on M5: wick rejection, body close, strong
  close, pin bar, engulfing, or hammer/shooting star can re-anchor the stop to
  the trigger wick. Scanner-confirmed reactions do not require a qualifying
  M1 candle while their executable quote is inside the confirmed zone;
  non-reaction families retain their M1 timing policy. No candlestick logic
  crosses into `ctrader-engine`.

### Changed
- `/algo_status` adds compact profile, open group count, observed regime, and
  last route (strategy · status · reason) while staying well under Telegram's
  text limit (soft budget ~1200 chars; handler still hard-clips at 4000).
- V7 publication now retains a seven-day TTL-bound dedup tombstone and a full
  symbol/cycle owner record. The C# executor keeps its restart payload under a
  separate recovery key, preserving the Python plan payload's short TTL.
- Setup-card status is now a typed, atomic, monotonic Redis state. Delayed
  scanner/worker events cannot regress `PLAN PUBLISHED` to queued, preflight,
  or waiting-retest.
- Scanner-confirmed reactions publish in the durable worker attempt only when
  BUY ask or SELL bid is inside the raw entry zone plus contract tolerance.
  Nearby price outside the zone remains `WAITING_RETEST`; same-cycle zone
  re-entry does not require M1, while non-reaction strategies keep their
  family-specific M1 requirement. `AUTO_TRADE_MAX_ENTRY_DISTANCE_PIPS`
  remains only a mechanical executor anti-chase ceiling.
- TradePlan V7 persistence is atomic: deterministic plan key, published state,
  and stream event are committed by one Redis Lua operation, so concurrent
  M1/ready events and crash retries cannot publish two initial plans.
- Confluence merge width is now `6` price units. The #140 actionability,
  key-level ambiguity, and range-context disagreement policies observe by
  default behind explicit flags, so same-side merged structures continue to
  setup confirmation; genuinely overlapping BUY/SELL structures still gate.
- `map_strategy.py` selects mapped zones from `market_map.actionable_entries`
  (the uncapped structural pool) instead of `market_map.entries` (the
  Telegram-display-capped list), so the per-side display cap can no longer
  silently determine which structural zone is reachable for execution.
- Auto-trade Telegram cards no longer say "Algo bot READY" when Python
  merely publishes a V6 candidate; that headline is now "Algo bot PLAN
  PUBLISHED" - READY is reserved for the executor actually arming a plan.
- Scale-in adds (momentum and pullback) share the same volume-split cap:
  each tranche is limited to `AUTO_TRADE_ADD_SIZE_RATIO` (default `0.5`) of the
  initial tranche size, in addition to exposure/risk/add-cap ceilings. Python
  mirror: `app.autotrade.scale_in_sizing`.
- HTF analysis context moved from M30 to H1: the stack is now a single
  H1->M15->M5 source. `CTRADER_TIMEFRAMES` default is `M1,M5,M15,H1`
  (`ctrader-engine` subscribes and backfills H1 directly from cTrader,
  `TimeframeCodec` gained an `H1` mapping); `scanner_htf` default is
  `H1,M15`. M5 remains the setup formation/confirmation timeframe,
  unchanged. `detectors.build_context` now fails HTF bias closed to
  `"unknown"` (not `"up"`/`"down"`, and distinct from the legitimate
  `"range"` state) until H1 has at least 50 closed bars, instead of
  silently falling back to M15/M5-only bias while H1 warms up after a
  fresh subscribe or a redeploy gap.
- Setup delivery is now one forming card per setup (anchored to
  `setup_lifecycle.py`'s `setup_id`, stored at `auto_trade:forming_message:
  {setup_id}` alongside its chat id) with a reply-threaded lifecycle:
  `plan_armed`/`order_filled`/`take_profit`/`stop_moved`/`position_closed`
  reply directly to the card instead of scattering standalone messages
  (`delivery_thread_lifecycle`, default on). Re-detection of the same setup
  edits the existing card (`app/autotrade/setup_card.py`) rather than
  posting a new one. Rejected, invalidated and expired setups have their
  card deleted and produce no message at all - no more "EXECUTOR REJECTED"/
  "SETUP INVALIDATED" spam - and are never re-carded afterwards
  (`delivery_delete_on_terminal`, default on; falls back to editing the card
  to a neutral terminal state if Telegram's deletion window has passed).
  New `ARMED_WAITING_TRIGGER` setups expire via their own `expires_at` if
  price never enters the executable entry zone; a build rejection after
  zone/M1 confirmation and a scanner-detected invalidation for a
  still-waiting setup both route through the same delete-the-card path
  instead of a "rejected" card. A position with no `setup_lifecycle` record
  (eg. an older V6 position) is unaffected - lifecycle replies fall back to
  the pre-P4 position-id reply chain exactly as before.

### Removed
- Remove `AUTO_TRADE_EXECUTE_MAX_DISTANCE_PIPS` and `distance_proximity` as
  positive execution authorization. Distance remains telemetry/ranking only
  and cannot publish outside a strategy entry zone.
- The private M1 range gate (`app/autotrade/gate.py`) and the M1
  mapped-zone reaction (`map_strategy.py::_select_reaction_detailed`'s M1
  touch/rejection detector) no longer originate trade candidates - M1 is
  retained only as input for a future entry trigger, not as an autonomous
  setup source. The M1-reaction path's live-quote zone-widening
  (`entry_low = min(entry.lo - tolerance, price)`) is removed with it.
  Market Map's structural pool (`actionable_entries`) is unchanged and
  still reachable via `_select_reaction_detailed`, which now only ever
  reports the nearest tracked/executable zone (`waiting_for_touch`) rather
  than promoting one to a `StrategyMatch`. `evaluate_auto_scalp_gate` and
  `evaluate_range_box_eligibility` are still called for regime
  classification and status telemetry respectively, but their output can no
  longer construct an `ExecutionIntent`.

### Fixed
- cTrader now verifies the configured market-data account broker before
  symbol resolution, historical backfill or live subscription. A token that
  also grants an IC Markets account can no longer silently feed IC bars while
  the executor is configured for FP Markets; feed and execution both use the
  configured FP Markets account.
- Restore end-to-end V7 runtime consistency: Python no longer discards a
  successful `_publish_trade_plan_v7` result, published setups reconcile
  instead of re-entering preflight/invalidation, and terminal lifecycle
  failures map explicitly without permitting `PLAN_PUBLISHED -> INVALIDATED`.
- Scanner execution eligibility now honors the complete policy result,
  including `allowed`, exact reason, hard-block status, and measured evidence;
  denied setups remain analysis-only even when their provisional R/R passes.
- C# TradePlan consumption no longer depends on reflection-disabled JSON
  overloads. Malformed plans are durably rejected per message, transient
  failures retain the stream cursor for retry, and later valid plans continue
  through the same consumer session.
- Identical Telegram setup-card edits are local no-ops, and Telegram's
  `message is not modified` response is treated as success without traceback,
  fallback card creation, or retry storms.
- Manual `/algo` envelopes now carry an explicit
  `bypass_analysis_gates=true` contract and bypass scanner arbitration,
  confirmation, R/R, barrier, cooldown, and overlap analysis while retaining
  executor broker-mechanical safety.
- Scanner-confirmed structural reactions no longer lose valid entries to a
  forced arm-only worker cycle. In-zone M5 confirmations now run final V7
  preflight and publication in the same call; reactions outside the execution
  zone wait for a side-aware quote retest. Optional M1 evaluation scans every
  eligible unprocessed bar and applies one common zone-intersection gate to all
  six candle patterns, preventing stale triggers from anchoring a later entry.
- Separate scanner observations from actionable setups before lifecycle
  creation. Opposing cross-side reactions now resolve deterministically,
  ambiguous generic key levels remain analysis-only, and the nearest
  opposing `MarketMap.actionable_entries` barrier caps target room before
  reward/risk evaluation. Invalid or zero-room geometry blocks in observe,
  balanced, strict, conservative and demo-eval modes; the worker repeats the
  same pure geometry check before final TradePlan V7 publication. Raw
  observations and measured rejection reasons remain available in scanner
  status, detect logs and metrics without creating a forming card.
- Preserve detector quality when same-side structural detections merge:
  merged quality is now the strongest member's `confluence`, while
  `confluence_tags` remains the separate structural-diversity dimension.
- Keep preflight strategy-route diagnostics (`waiting`, `blocked`, and
  `executor_rejected`) in Redis/history/metrics but make them Telegram-silent,
  removing standalone `Algo bot BLOCKED` cards for invalid stop geometry,
  regime mismatch, entry drift/hard-cap, and equivalent execution vetoes.
  Analysis cards without an executable match now use a neutral
  `ANALYSIS ONLY` label instead of presenting another blocked alert.
- Suppress the scanner's remaining legacy standalone `SETUP INVALIDATED`
  Telegram fallback. Broken structures now only retire scanner watch state;
  lifecycle-backed setups still transition terminal and have their forming
  card deleted, while detections without a setup record remain log-only.
- Wire `merge_confluence_zones` into scanner detection and forming-card
  identity: co-located same-side key-level / demand / supply / OB / FVG /
  breaker detections now share the merged zone id, union tags, one setup,
  one forming card, and the exact same execution claim instead of producing
  duplicate detector cards before the existing one-order-per-zone guard.
- Move the shared execution-policy reward/risk check into setup eligibility:
  setups below their family's `min_reward_risk` are recorded as
  `rr_pre_gate` but never confirm or form a card. The plan-build R/R check
  remains authoritative after quote-in-zone eligibility and optional M1 timing;
  a late failure expires and silently deletes the forming card instead of
  posting BLOCKED spam.
- Broker SL/TP exits discovered by reconcile without a confirmed OrderType no
  longer show `reason unconfirmed`. Close reason is inferred when the exit
  sits on the protective stop — both a clean full SL before any TP and a BE
  stop-out after booked targets. After booked TPs, Total /
  `group_realized_pips` reports the highest target reached (e.g. TP2 = 60)
  instead of a volume-weighted blend diluted by the BE residual (~22.8).
- Manual / algo / algo_manual journal history and `/trade_stats` now record
  the highest TP/pips hit (`legs_achieved_pips`), not a volume-fraction or
  lot-weighted net that dilutes booked targets with a later BE residual.
- Break-even buffer direction: `StopTrailPlanner.ProtectedBreakevenStop` had
  BUY/SELL swapped (adverse-side cushion instead of profit-side protection),
  moving a SELL entry 4100.74 BE+6 stop to 4100.80 instead of the correct
  4100.68. Corrected to BUY entry+buffer / SELL entry-buffer; never-worsens-
  an-existing-stop behavior unchanged.
- Independent autonomous strategy groups on a non-hedged (netting) broker
  account now fail closed before broker submission
  (`independent_strategy_requires_hedged_account`) instead of silently
  collapsing into the existing net position and blending two strategies'
  SL/TP - previously only opposite-direction groups were rejected, so two
  same-direction independent strategies (the incident: Trendline Reaction
  and Key Level Reaction, both SELL) could both be admitted.
- `ReconcileAsync` no longer deletes a tracked position's state and
  publishes `position_closed` after a single broker snapshot omits it;
  absence must now be independently confirmed across
  `AUTO_TRADE_POSITION_MISSING_CONFIRMATIONS` time-separated snapshots
  first (`position_missing_snapshot_suspected` /
  `_confirmed` / `_recovered`).
- Added a fatal-event guard (`broker_position_identity_group_conflict`) if
  the broker ever returns an already-tracked PositionId for a distinct
  independent group, so the existing group's state cannot be silently
  overwritten and no further autonomous groups are admitted until resolved.
- Block opposite-direction autonomous initial groups before stop/route planning:
  worker preflight rejects with `opposite_initial_group_active` when a tracked
  initial position exists on the other side; the C# executor runs the same guard
  before route resolution so rejections no longer surface as misleading
  `final_protective_stop_contract_mismatch` when e.g. SELL is open and BUY is
  attempted.
- Suppress redundant `SETUP INVALIDATED` owner alerts after autonomous entry:
  only Telegram forming cards are tracked (not every claimed detection),
  overlapping setups share one level-band watch, open same-direction positions
  silence further invalidation pings, and `opened` clears the watch state.
- Decouple `SETUP FORMING` card volume from the execution digest: advisory
  cards are capped by `SCANNER_CARD_TOP_N` (default `2`), always suppress
  overlapping opposing directions, and deduplicate structural reactions by a
  stable level bucket instead of their jittering execution `structural_id`.
  Candidate tracking and publication remain unchanged.
- Align the C# scale-in eligibility gate with the adverse-side
  protected-breakeven stop produced after TP1. Momentum and pullback adds now
  accept the configured BUY `entry - buffer` / SELL `entry + buffer`
  threshold while still rejecting stops even one tick less protected.
- Make protective-stop contracts route-aware: market candidates validate the
  entry-independent raw/base stop, source, adjustment, clamp, and zone identity
  while trading the stop recomputed at the live entry; resting
  `single_limit`/`zone_split` contracts retain strict entry, distance, and pip
  equality. This prevents normal publish-to-fill drift from causing
  `final_protective_stop_contract_mismatch`.
- Make entry contracts route-aware: market candidates observe publish-to-fill
  drift without rejecting it while the existing 10-pip entry-zone cap remains
  the chase guard; resting entries remain strict. Correct the losing-side stop
  metric to `final_stop_not_on_losing_side`.
- Correct ApexVoid Algo break-even protection to **BE+6 broker ticks**
  (`AUTO_TRADE_BE_BUFFER_TICKS=6` × tick `0.01` = **0.06** price), not
  6 trading pips × `pip_size=0.1` (= 0.60). Buffer stays on the adverse side
  of fill: BUY `4087.66` → `4087.60`; SELL `4087.66` → `4087.72`. Config
  health compares `break_even_buffer_ticks` and `symbol_tick_size`; Telegram
  Risk Protected cards report `BE+6 ticks` and `Buffer: 0.06`. Deprecated
  `AUTO_TRADE_BE_BUFFER_PIPS` is read as a tick count only.
- Align autonomous publication with the executor entry-distance hard cap
  (`AUTO_TRADE_MAX_ENTRY_DISTANCE_PIPS`): adaptive strategy drift stays an
  observation tolerance, Algo bot READY / candidate XADD require the executor
  envelope, and outside-cap setups emit Algo bot WAIT while remaining retained.
- Rename Telegram route cards from AUTO READY/WAIT/BLOCKED/CHECKING to
  Algo bot READY/WAIT/BLOCKED/CHECKING.
- Rename owner Telegram menu commands from `/auto_*` to `/algo_*` (legacy
  `/auto_*` aliases remain), and make `/algo_status` report failures instead of
  failing silently when the status card errors or exceeds Telegram's length limit.
- Resolve concrete execution routes (`market` / `single_limit` / `zone_split`)
  before protective-stop planning for Key Level, Trendline, and other
  reaction families so strict stop contracts no longer publish unresolved
  `either` and mismatch at the executor.
- Suppress target evaluation on pre-fill quotes; enrich stop-moved Telegram
  cards with TP trigger context; deliver one canonical terminal Telegram
  result per trade group.
- Add a recovery-only `broker_reconciling` state: recovery claims never write
  normal `processing`, an expired recovery lease stays recovery-required, and
  a crashed recovery worker can never decay into a normal retry that places a
  duplicate order. `broker_outcome_unknown` releases to `retryable_error`
  only from the recovery-active state after the absence quorum.
- Heartbeat the recovery lease across the whole broker reconciliation
  (group-plan load, snapshots, delays, final fenced mutation); on ownership
  loss the stale recovery worker stops without counting confirmations,
  releasing the record or deleting the group plan.
- Persist broker-absence confirmation progress durably in Redis with a
  fenced, Redis-time-separated counter: an immediate process restart cannot
  accelerate the quorum, stale recovery owners cannot increment it, and
  progress survives recovery crashes. Validate quorum timing fatally at
  startup (confirmations ≥ 2, positive recheck interval, timeout covering the
  configured quorum).
- Validate structured candidate execution records identically in Python, C#
  and Redis Lua: explicit supported `version`, explicit known `state`, exact
  identity — no defaults, no fallback to `published`, no legacy downgrade for
  malformed JSON; publication reconciliation refuses restoration over them.
- Persist the actually resolved execution route and the exact submitted
  client order IDs in the group plan before the first broker side effect
  (including `either` routes resolving to market/limit/zone), expose the
  broker-echoed `ClientOrderId` on positions and pending orders, prioritise
  exact client-order identity in recovery matching, treat mismatched exact
  identities as conflicts, and adopt partial zone outcomes instead of
  resubmitting or confirming absence.
- Require consecutive broker absence confirmations (and deterministic client
  order identity) before releasing a recovery-required candidate for retry, so
  delayed broker visibility cannot create a duplicate order; expire
  `broker_submitting` into recovery rather than normal reclaim.
- Fail closed on unknown planned execution routes and incomplete planned entry
  / leg-entry contracts before any broker mutation.
- Require exact `candidate_id` and `stream_event_id` on structured execution
  records in Redis Lua, Python reconciliation, and C# parsers (legacy plain
  markers stay conservatively compatible).
- Cancel lease-ownership tokens before best-effort heartbeat metrics, and
  separate `broker_response_unknown` from `executor_lease_lost_after_broker`.
- Make retryable candidates reclaimable with a typed claim disposition so a
  failed attempt can be retried without advancing the stream cursor, and keep
  `broker_outcome_unknown` out of the normal retry path until deterministic
  broker reconciliation adopts or disproves the order.
- Fence every lease-owned mutation on exact candidate, stream-event and lease
  token identity (a missing token never authorises completion), keep terminal
  records immutable, and heartbeat the lease through long broker calls so a
  successor cannot claim mid-placement.
- Resolve the execution route and planned entry before validating the final
  stop; publish the same planned entry from Python; preserve the approved
  absolute stop after fill slippage; require an exact opposing-zone identity
  for pushed stops; and keep retryable / broker-unknown lifecycle states
  nonterminal so a successful retry is not refused as a backward transition.
- Decode structured candidate records with `cjson` during publication
  reconciliation, recognise every executor state, and refuse unknown legacy
  markers instead of treating them as retryable.
- Enforce a shared final protective-stop contract (`stop_plan_version=2`) so
  Python-approved final stop equals C# validated stop equals broker stop;
  fold opposing-zone push into the planner and reject
  `final_protective_stop_contract_mismatch` before any broker mutation.
- Replace scalar candidate markers with structured execution records and
  two-phase all-or-nothing publication reconciliation that preserves executor
  progress (`processing`/`ordered`/…) without partial ownership restores.
- Fence executor claims with token-owned renewable leases so stale workers
  cannot renew, transition, complete, release, or submit for a successor;
  mark post-broker uncertainty as `broker_outcome_unknown`.
- Separate lifecycle history from lifecycle transitions: telemetry and
  unknown events no longer default to `managing` or write
  `lifecycle_state:service`.
- Preserve ranked-intent priority under concurrent delivery with a token-owned
  cycle arbitration lock, typed publication outcomes, and terminal-only
  fallback; make the Redis stream authoritative and reconcile orphan
  candidate/reaction/thesis/cycle claims without another `XADD`.
- Evaluate Python reward/risk against the same Decimal protective-stop plan as
  the C# executor, carry candidate stop-plan v1 in contract v6, and reject
  cross-service differences beyond one symbol tick.
- Bound Redis group plans with lifecycle TTLs and remove them after rejection,
  dry-run, rollback, cancellation, range flip, full TP, or terminal closure;
  clear stale terminal reasons when a route later recovers.
- Finish the autonomous execution-integrity pipeline: every scanner/private
  intent now passes side-effect-free typed preflight before arbitration, one
  initial owns each closed M1 cycle atomically, exact preflight/arbitration/
  publication evidence is retained, and production Redis scripting fails
  closed without orphan candidate/reaction/thesis claims.
- Carry tier risk into every C# autonomous initial sizing path, separate order
  type from entry distribution, compute fill-relative targets from broker
  fills, enforce absolute/hybrid structural targets, and preserve exact manual
  `/algo` TP prices through reconciliation.
- Stop same-match replay from inflating confluence, make private range IDs
  formation-episode aware, render real range-side ownership state, and
  attribute status to the exact candidate/strategy that published.
- Make the autonomous execution pipeline single-winner and crash-safe: a
  cross-engine arbiter now selects at most one same-direction initial intent
  per M1 cycle, C# rejects opposite or already-active initial groups, candidate
  claim plus stream append is atomic, and the processing lease is 120 seconds.
- Keep Private Range producer-owned by its native M1 auction detector, resolve
  and persist range context only after the final private observation, carry a
  stable formation-episode ID across small rail drift, and prevent rail rearm
  while a candidate, pending order, or position still owns that side.
- Make `observe` overlap outcomes genuinely advisory, classify missing/invalid
  price data as `data_gap`/`warming_up` instead of chop, enforce chop as a hard
  Range Box/Range Edge eligibility contract, and enforce every declared
  strategy execution-policy field before publication.
- Prefer fresh structural matches over stale high-confluence duplicates,
  tighten narrow-zone and cross-source range compatibility, derive risk from
  the final tier, compute drift from remaining target room, and use the shared
  strategy-aware drift contract for mapped entries.
- Persist exact candidate-to-strategy attribution, symbol-specific status,
  unique route-funnel metrics, material-only route history, private
  range/trend route outcomes, and immediate scanner range withdrawal on a
  missing M5 execution frame.
- Require live producer-owned scanner/private range contexts for Range Box and
  Range Edge; withdraw absent sources immediately, stop resolver TTL refresh of
  source keys, and suppress stale scanner/worker status snapshots.
- Make Forming Cards report `AUTO CHECKING`, `AUTO WAIT`, `AUTO BLOCKED`, and
  `AUTO READY` from persisted per-match route outcomes; `AUTO READY` is now
  emitted only after the candidate stream `XADD` succeeds.
- Canonicalize StrategyMatch and Mapped Zone options, fail conflicting legacy
  aliases, route every active multi-match independently, and allow C# to
  atomically transition a publisher's `published` claim to `processing`.
- Exclude oversized context-only supply/demand zones from execution barriers
  while preserving them in the analysis pipeline.

### Added

- Add opt-in `SCANNER_GATE_*` M5/M15 structure filters for round-number-only
  anchors, exhausted levels, and low-confluence counter-bias reactions inside
  ranges. All filters default off; enabled rejects are removed consistently
  from cards and execution and recorded as `structure_gated`.

- Added real-Redis production-Lua concurrency/orphan-recovery tests, shared
  Python/C# stop-plan parity fixtures, and pending-fill restart/terminal-plan
  cleanup regressions.

- Added `AUTO_TRADE_MARKET_MAP_GUARD_ENABLED` so Market Map execution and its
  overlap/barrier guard are independently controlled. If omitted, the guard
  follows `AUTO_TRADE_MAPPED_ZONE_ENABLED`.

- Owner DM `/auto_close_all confirm` flattens all open ApexVoid Algo broker
  positions (and cancels pending labeled limits), pauses new entries, and
  books **Total net** from the real broker close fill (not a stop estimate).

- Range Box Scalp trades with Full TP **> 70** pips now scale out 50% at
  +30 pips from the broker fill, then ride the original Full TP for the
  remainder (`AUTO_TRADE_RANGE_BOX_SCALE_OUT_*`). Break-even stop move after
  scale-out stays off by default.

- Promote Key Level, Demand/Supply Zone, Session Level, and Trendline reactions
  to first-class executable scanner strategies (stable structural IDs, shared
  closed-bar confirmation lookback, bias as context not a hard gate). Generic
  `Zone Reaction` is removed from `DEFAULT_DETECTORS`. Mapped Zone remains
  disabled (`AUTO_TRADE_MAPPED_ZONE_ENABLED=false`).

### Fixed

- Owner `/trade_close` on a tracked algo position now drops Redis/engine
  state immediately after the broker fill so reconcile cannot re-book the
  same exit with a stop-loss estimate (duplicate POSITION CLOSED / wrong
  Total net).

- Algo `POSITION CLOSED` cards now include **Total net pips** (volume-weighted).
  Broker reconciliation closes also book the remaining volume into the weighted
  net and emit `group_result`. Partial TP cards show **Leg** pips plus **Net so
  far**. Manual/algo VIP booking measures signed pips from the real
  `broker_fill_price` when present, not only the advertised zone edge.
- Mapped Zone Reaction now allows at most one active initial group per
  structural thesis. A newer M1 touch/confirmation that produces a different
  `reaction_id` for the same `thesis_id` is suppressed via Redis
  `auto_trade:thesis_claim:{thesis_id}` (SET NX / Lua) before publish, with C#
  `active_thesis_group` defence-in-depth. Rearm requires the prior group to be
  terminal, price to leave the *raw* structural zone by
  `AUTO_TRADE_MAP_REACTION_REARM_ATR`, remain outside for
  `AUTO_TRADE_MAP_REACTION_REARM_BARS` closed M1 bars, then re-enter and form a
  newer confirmation. Keep `AUTO_TRADE_MAPPED_ZONE_ENABLED=false` until the
  thesis-lock images are deployed; `AUTO_TRADE_MAP_THESIS_LOCK_ENABLED=true`.
- Telegram ApexVoid Algo cards now show only the essential trade lifecycle
  (`order_filled` / opened, TP booked, risk protected, closed, group result,
  executor rejects). Pre-fill noise (`candidate_published`, `order_submitted`,
  `order_accepted`, `managing`, config/broker fatals) stays in Redis lifecycle
  streams and metrics but is suppressed at the Telegram render boundary. Partial
  TP cards no longer show remaining lot or volume lines.
- Mapped Zone Reaction now executes each structural reaction sequence at most
  once. Match/group identity derives from a stable `reaction_id` (symbol,
  strategy, direction, structural zone, touch/confirmation bar timestamps,
  reaction type) instead of the worker `event_ts` or spot-expanded entry
  bands. Redis `auto_trade:reaction_claim:{reaction_id}` SET NX claims the
  reaction across restarts; `same_thesis` and group IDs follow the reaction,
  and the C# executor rejects `duplicate_reaction_active` without Telegram
  spam. Zone coordinate jitter such as `4054.26–4062.31` vs `4054.08–4062.16`
  resolves to one `structural_zone_id`. Keep
  `AUTO_TRADE_MAPPED_ZONE_ENABLED=false` until verified on demo.

### Added

- Added typed, source-aware structural guard decisions with
  `observe|balanced|strict` policy modes, per-outcome Redis counters,
  `/auto_status` guard diagnostics, and non-destructive zone-reconciliation
  shadow metrics.
- Added a dedicated owner `/algo` execution path that preserves the supplied
  direction, entry zone, absolute SL, TP prices, setup and candidate/group
  ownership. Manual orders may coexist with autonomous or opposite-direction
  exposure on a broker-confirmed hedged demo account.
- Added executor-truth Telegram states for manual requests (`LIMIT ORDER
  PLACED`, `POSITION OPENED`, `DRY-RUN ONLY`, and machine-readable rejection)
  plus fatal Python/C# config-manifest checks for execution mode and Redis
  stream split-brain.
- Added the explicit `demo_eval` auto-trade profile, independent
  same-direction strategy groups, two-sided range analysis, multi-match
  tracking, unified scanner/private `RangeContext`, complete candidate
  lifecycle history, and Python/C# startup contract health manifests.
- Expanded `/auto_status` and execution Telegram cards with account capability,
  config health, resolved range/barriers, both rail states, active matches,
  strategy groups, counters, and real executor lifecycle badges.

### Changed

- Python and C# now resolve one versioned auto-trade configuration contract
  (manifest v2, candidate v5) from canonical environment names. Target/symbol
  sets are canonical in manifests while range target selection remains
  largest-fitting-first at runtime; execution max age and Redis storage TTL
  are separate settings.
- Executor readiness is published at `auto_trade:executor_readiness`.
  Non-hedged demo capability and storage-TTL drift are warning-only, with an
  explicit `AUTO_TRADE_NON_HEDGED_OPPOSITE_POLICY` for opposite exposure.
- Demo evaluation treats HTF bias as scoring/reporting metadata. Valid local
  BUY and SELL structures, including counter-bias mapped zones and trend
  pullbacks, remain executable and tracked; the cross-engine arbiter chooses
  one direction and at most one initial publication per M1 cycle.
- Initial strategy candidates always own independent groups. Only a trend
  candidate carrying an explicit compatible `parent_group_id` can enter the
  scale-in route.
- Demo evaluation does not require flat bot-owned XAU exposure for a
  same-direction initial group. Opposite autonomous initial exposure is
  rejected before broker submission, while duplicate candidate, reaction,
  thesis, group, and pending-order ownership remain independently enforced.

### Fixed

- Fixed the post-23-Jul demo-evaluation frequency collapse: a strategy's own
  key level/supply/demand source is no longer treated as an opposing barrier;
  ambiguous overlaps and temporary drift retain their exact StrategyMatch;
  counter-bias targets adapt around structure; and only confirmed stop-loss
  closures may enforce a zone cooldown.
- Fixed semantically identical Python/C# target ladders (descending versus
  ascending), numeric JSON forms, symbol ordering, FP Markets aliases, and
  demo account aliases being treated as fatal configuration mismatches that
  disabled all autonomous execution.
- Fixed owner `/algo` orders being filtered by autonomous confluence, regime,
  opposing-zone, exposure and scale-in gates, and fixed premature Telegram
  acknowledgement before the cTrader executor confirmed broker action.
- Fixed raw broker-name matching that rejected `FP Markets` when
  `AUTO_TRADE_EXPECTED_BROKER=fpmarkets`; broker identities now ignore spacing,
  punctuation and case.
- Zone-fill no longer hard-rejects when price is already inside the entry zone
  (production: Breakout Continuation SELL ~4025.59 inside 4024.37–4027.45).
  Geometry-aware routing classifies `price_inside_zone` / `invalid_limit_side`
  and falls back to `ProcessSingleInitialAsync` with reason
  `zone-fill geometry invalid; single-entry fallback` when
  `AUTO_TRADE_ZONE_FILL_FALLBACK_ENABLED=true` (default).
- Support/resistance detection is symmetric with dynamic clustering, controlled
  fallback barriers (`source=fallback_local_extreme`), and explicit range
  states (`no_range` / `provisional_range` / `confirmed_range` /
  `post_impulse_range` / `broken_range`). The previous 2-resistance/0-support
  scanner shape now either produces a confirmed fallback support or a
  machine-readable `missing_side_reason`.
- Market Map execute distance gains a small configurable tolerance
  (`AUTO_TRADE_MAP_EXECUTE_TOLERANCE_PIPS` / `_ATR`) so zones slightly outside
  the raw ATR window still execute after unchanged M1 touch + rejection.
- Entry drift is strategy-aware (range / trend / map ATR multipliers) instead of
  a single universal pip gate.

### Added

- Multi-strategy match storage at `auto_trade:strategy_matches:{symbol}` while
  preserving the legacy primary key `auto_trade:strategy_match:{symbol}`.
  Same-thesis setups merge as confluence; distinct theses stay tracked.
- Execution quality tiers A/B/C with risk multipliers
  (`AUTO_TRADE_TIER_A/B_RISK_MULTIPLIER`, post-impulse and one-sided multipliers).
  Tier B raises trade frequency at reduced risk; Tier C stays analysis-only.
- Adaptive range target ladder default `20,30,40,50,70` with 3-pip buffer and
  optional min RR (`AUTO_TRADE_RANGE_MIN_RR`).

### Fixed

- Regime classification no longer treats every narrow staircase step as chop.
  Height and containment tests stay as the primary chop signals; an additive
  directional override (LH/LL or HH/HL pairs over
  `AUTO_TRADE_REGIME_DIRECTION_LOOKBACK`, default `120`, with net displacement
  ≥ `AUTO_TRADE_REGIME_MIN_DISPLACEMENT_ATR`, default `4.0`) reclassifies as
  trend when both conditions hold, and records the override in the reason
  list. Ships dark behind `AUTO_TRADE_REGIME_DIRECTION_ENABLED=false`. Every
  scan still writes `auto_trade:regime_compare:{symbol}` with
  `{legacy}:{new}` so the counterfactual can be measured for 48h before
  enabling. The same override feeds the private-strategy regime gate when
  the flag is on so Trend becomes eligible on a directed tape.
- Market Map reaction distance no longer discards zones beyond `1.5×ATR`.
  Tracking (`AUTO_TRADE_MAP_TRACK_DISTANCE_ATR`, default `8.0`) and execution
  (`AUTO_TRADE_MAP_EXECUTE_DISTANCE_ATR`, default `1.5`) are separate: distant
  zones report as `waiting_for_touch` with both distances on `/auto_status`,
  while only the execute window may place an immediate market entry after
  unchanged M1 touch + rejection. Zones beyond track distance report
  `no_zone_in_range`.

### Added

- Added a second scale-in trigger, pullback add, alongside the existing
  momentum add — both now share one set of averaging-down/exposure
  invariants (favorable entry, profitable group, initial reached
  breakeven, every stop known, tranche cooldown, `MaxTranches`) but never
  both fire on the same candidate: fresh in-direction displacement is
  always evaluated as momentum regardless of anything else, otherwise a
  counter-direction/stale-displacement candidate is evaluated as pullback
  if `AUTO_TRADE_ADD_PULLBACK_ENABLED=true` (default `false`). Pullback
  requires no counter-direction BOS since the group opened, a retrace
  ratio from the extreme price back toward the initial entry within
  `AUTO_TRADE_ADD_PULLBACK_MIN_RETRACE`/`_MAX_RETRACE` (default
  `0.20`-`0.70`), the add entry inside a mapped zone on the correct side,
  and an M1 rejection candle; its stop sits beyond the retrace extreme
  (never clamped — a stop that would exceed the trend envelope rejects the
  add instead), and a combined-group-worst-case check
  (`AUTO_TRADE_ADD_MAX_GROUP_RISK_PCT`, default `3.0`) is enforced on top
  of the existing budget-based sizing check, since a pullback add's own
  stop isn't guaranteed to sit in profit the way the initial tranche's
  does.   Every scale-in tranche (momentum and pullback) is capped at
  `AUTO_TRADE_ADD_SIZE_RATIO` (default `0.5`) of the initial tranche's own
  size on top of exposure/risk/add-cap ceilings. Every rejection now
  names both the mode evaluated and the specific condition
  (`auto_trade:add_reject:{symbol}:{mode}:{condition}`), and each tranche
  is tagged `add_momentum`/`add_pullback` in its order message and
  persisted setup so the two are measurable separately from each other and
  from initial entries. Along the way, fixed the reason momentum adds have
  never fired in production (`/auto_status` showed `adds 0` regardless of
  regime): the only function that ever publishes a `regime="trend"`
  candidate never attached the displacement/BOS/opposing-level context
  `ScaleInTriggerPlanner` needs to accept a momentum add — box-scalp
  candidates carried it, trend candidates never did. Ships dark: both the
  new pullback flag and its prerequisite trend-candidate wiring land with
  `AUTO_TRADE_ADD_PULLBACK_ENABLED=false`, so momentum add behavior is
  otherwise unaffected until deliberately enabled.
- Added an inspectable Market Map strategy working set with one-hour Redis
  snapshots, `/auto_status` entry/filter/distance telemetry, rendered-map
  divergence warnings, and a default-enabled quality-gated `counter_bias` reaction
  path whose profit ladder is capped at box EQ.
- Added opt-in broker-confirmed range flip execution for defined box scalps,
  with opposing-edge targets, a `flip_pending` claim, timeout alerts, and the
  existing flat-exposure guard preserved. The feature defaults off.
- Added durable `algo_auto` and `algo_manual` execution ledgers plus per-stream
  fill count, win rate, mean R, total pips, and mean stop distance in trade
  stats and weekly reports. `/algo` remains visible in manual stats while
  `all_unique` removes the duplicate from combined figures.

- Added real broker execution for `/ algo` manual signals (PR 3 of 3):
  `ctrader-engine` now consumes `manual_trade:intents` (via a new
  Python-side bridge onto the existing `auto_trade:candidates` pipeline) and
  places a single pending LIMIT order at the owner's exact entry zone,
  absolute stop loss, and take-profit ladder — never a re-derived structure
  stop or fixed pip ladder like the autonomous box-scalp/trend/
  strategy-match engines use for themselves. Owner-override commands
  (`/trade_close`/`/trade_sl`/`/trade_cancel`) now route to the real
  position/pending order once a signal is algo-armed or filled, instead of
  only ever mutating Postgres/Telegram. Broker fill/TP/SL/close events drive
  the same `trade_ops.py → post_result → broadcast.fanout_update` lifecycle
  path a manually-confirmed signal already uses, so VIP/public channel posts
  update exactly like a manual command would. Ships dark:
  `MANUAL_ALGO_ENABLED` stays `false` by default.

- Added manual-signal broker execution infrastructure (PR 2 of 3; no broker
  executes real orders yet — this PR is plumbing only). `manual_signals`
  gained `execution_mode`/`execution_status`/`execution_intent_id`/
  `execution_revision`/`broker_position_id`/`broker_fill_price`/
  `execution_error` columns; a new versioned `ManualTradeIntent` contract
  (`app.signals.manual_intent`) carries the owner's exact entered SL/TP
  (not a re-derived structure stop) and publishes to the new
  `manual_trade:intents` Redis stream; and manual DM signals now accept an
  opt-in `/ algo` suffix (composes with the existing `/ vip` and `/ scalp`
  suffixes) that arms this contract when `MANUAL_ALGO_ENABLED=true`
  (default `false`). Nothing in this codebase consumes
  `manual_trade:intents` yet — a future `ctrader-engine` change is required
  before an `/ algo` signal can actually place a broker order.

- Added typed scanner-to-Algo strategy routing: the strongest completed M5
  detector match is transported with stable identity, expiry, entry/stop/TP
  context, attribution, and `/auto_status` visibility.

- Added per-position Telegram reply threads for ApexVoid Algo trade events,
  including standalone fallback when the original message is unavailable.
- Added proactive cTrader access-token refresh ahead of expiry, defensive
  `expiresIn` unit resolution, a host-mounted file mirror for rotated token
  recovery after Redis-volume loss, and rate-limited Telegram lifecycle alerts.
- Added an independent two-edge range-box scalp contract for ApexVoid Algo:
  BUY lower-edge and SELL upper-edge M1 rejections, full-position +50/+70-pip
  exits, repeated-touch 60-bar auction boxes, midpoint edge re-arming, stable
  box IDs, and confirmed-breakout retirement.
- Added shareable ApexVoid Algo Telegram cards for entries, full take profit,
  stop protection, warnings, and status without the old Auto Trader branding.
- Added momentum scale-in as independent, structure-stopped tranche positions
  under balance-based group loss, exposure, add-risk, and ladder invariants;
  averaging down is explicitly refused by design.
- Added planned two-limit zone fill (disabled by default), tranche/group tags,
  restart-safe multi-position reconciliation, binding-term telemetry,
  with-adds vs no-adds stats, and `AUTO_TRADE_ADD_REQUIRE_RISK_FREE`.
- Added weighted largest-remainder target splitting, broker-valid adaptive
  target plans for `0.02-0.04` lots, persisted TP ordinals, a monotonic stop
  ladder, and explicit target-weight and break-even-buffer controls.
- Added fingerprint-based cTrader refresh-token seeding with automatic cache
  reset, the `--reset-token-cache` operator command, live-account grant
  warnings, actionable account-grant remediation, and the optional
  `AUTO_TRADE_REQUIRE_DEMO_ONLY_TOKEN` hardening switch.
- Added demo-only cTrader market execution for qualified scalp
  candidates, with Fusion/Hedged/Trading-scope hard locks, one-position and
  freshness/spread/news/daily-cap gates, restart reconciliation, and durable
  Redis candidate/event contracts.
- Added operator-defined balance-band volume planning (`0.02-0.30` lots), a
  server-side `$6.5` stop, and broker-valid partial closes at
  `30/60/90/120/200` pips.
- Added owner auto-trade event DMs plus `/auto_status`, `/auto_pause`, and
  `/auto_resume` on both Telegram bots.
- Added a private auto-scalp worker that consumes only raw cTrader M1/M5/M15
  OHLC and live spot data, publishes Redis execution candidates, and has no
  scanner, forming-signal, Market Map, or Telegram dependency.

- Added lenient trailing setup-tag parsing, setup metadata in manual-signal
  confirmations, owner-only `/trade_untagged` backfill listings, and absolute
  `id:<db_id>` targeting for `/trade_tag`.
- Introduced this changelog and the repository rule requiring future changes to
  update it.
- Added deterministic significant-swing trendlines, diagonal reaction anchors,
  trendline confluence scoring, and trendline break-and-retest detection.
- Added the Box Breakout setup for accepted consolidation escapes, including
  displacement/two-close acceptance, edge retests, measured moves, and coil
  scoring.
- Added trendline, coil-contraction, breakout-buffer, acceptance-bar, and
  breakout-age configuration knobs.
- Added the two-sided Market Map assembler and monospace renderer, with scored
  zone tiers, bare levels, trendlines, breakout-retest pivots, human rounding,
  display merging, and per-side caps.
- Added owner-only `/trade_map`, guarded session-open Market Map DMs, scanner
  alert map references, gate-report map counts, and Market Map configuration
  knobs.
- Added the Market Map fallback ladder for spent zones, swept session levels,
  and round numbers so both trade sides retain actionable references.
- Added validated near-price SCALP range-edge rails to Market Map renders and
  scanner alerts, with a configurable display radius.
- Added deterministic Range Edge Scalp detection for both sides of local
  ranges, using repeated touch episodes, wick rejection, breakout invalidation,
  edge confirmation, EQ/opposing-edge targets, and shared Market Map rails.
- Added Range Edge Scalp configuration and scanner telemetry for barrier counts,
  active range quality, and live edge-touch state.
- Added a three-state market regime classifier (chop/trend/breakout) for
  ApexVoid Algo telemetry and private strategy context.
- Added trend-pullback and breakout-continuation entry modes reusing the
  existing price-action toolkit (swings, structure, displacement/zones,
  session liquidity), plus level-anchored target selection with
  spacing/de-dup rules and a fixed-ladder fallback.
- Added box-breakout as a tradeable setup instead of purely informational
  bookkeeping: an accepted, still-fresh box break now opens a position
  against the opposite box edge.
- Added 24h chop/trend/breakout share instrumentation on `/auto_status` and
  a one-shot owner DM when the chop share looks mistuned.
- Added the `AUTO_TRADE_TREND_ENABLED` kill switch (default off) and the C#
  `AUTO_TRADE_TREND_STOP_MIN_PIPS`/`AUTO_TRADE_TREND_STOP_MAX_PIPS`
  structure-stop band for trend-family candidates.

### Changed

- Raised the autonomous range-scalp minimum stop from 15 to 30 pips and added
  a 0.15 ATR swept-wick clearance floor. Manual stops retain owner precedence:
  opposing-zone protection may widen and notify, but never tighten them.
- Broker execution events now persist their `algo_auto`/`algo_manual` stream
  at fill time; watcher runner telemetry replies to the engine TP thread for
  algo-armed manual signals.

- The notify-only price watcher now reads closed M1 bars from ctrader-feed's
  Redis window as its primary source instead of polling Tiingo. Tiingo
  remains as a fallback for a single tick when the ctrader-feed bar is
  missing or older than `WATCHER_CTRADER_STALE_SECONDS` (default 180s); the
  watcher now runs even without `TIINGO_API_KEY` set, it just has no
  fallback for a gap in that case.
- Scanner detector output now owns strategy selection. The Algo worker no
  longer re-confirms a matched setup with a second M1/M5 or Market Map gate,
  and private strategies select the higher-confluence match instead of using a
  regime label as a global veto.

### Fixed

- Fixed the Market Map strategy deadlock where a collapsed zone could become
  the reported nearest target even though the same loop would never execute
  it. Degenerate geometry is now rejected by ATR/absolute minimum width,
  counted and warned; unreachable zones produce an honest distance-limit
  reason instead of waiting indefinitely for a touch.
- Fixed three manual `/algo` execution gaps found from live cards: (1) a
  broker-confirmed TP hit rendered as a bare "booked X% · +N pips" with no
  indication of which configured target fired, unlike the watcher-driven
  `TPn hit` label a regular manual signal gets — `manual_execution.py` now
  threads the already-resolved target ordinal through to `render_result`,
  which prefixes both partial and final-close cards with `TPn`. (2) the
  owner got a duplicate "🤖 ApexVoid Algo" DM for every take_profit/
  stop_moved/position_closed event on a manual-algo position, on top of
  the VIP/public channel card the signal already gets — `take_profit`/
  `stop_moved`/`position_closed` reuse the same event types the autonomous
  engines use and weren't filtered by `setup`, unlike the `opened` event
  which already used a distinct type for this reason; `_deliver_auto_trade_
  event` now skips any event with `setup == "Manual Algo"` outright. (3) on
  larger manual-algo positions (table/risk sizing > 0.13 lots) the first
  partial booking scaled up proportionally with account size instead of
  staying a consistent size; `VolumePlanner.FixFirstLegVolume` now pins the
  first leg to ~0.05 lots and redistributes the remainder evenly across the
  rest when total volume exceeds that threshold.
- Fixed `reconcile_opposing` over-trimming the zone map (regression from
  PR #89, live 22-23 Jul 2026 incident: zero `SETUP FORMING` cards for 6+
  hours). The original implementation treated any nonzero overlap between
  opposing supply/demand zones as a conflict and re-compared already-trimmed
  zones on every pass, so on dense M5 FVG output the cascade could empty the
  map. Opposing overlap now requires the same overlap-*ratio* bar as
  same-side merging (`ZONE_RECONCILE_OVERLAP = 0.5`, full containment still
  scores 1.0), each zone can be a trim *target* at most once per call, and a
  circuit breaker (`ZONE_RECONCILE_MAX_FRACTION = 0.20`, evaluated only once
  there are at least 5 input zones) discards the whole pass and returns the
  input unchanged — logging a warning and incrementing
  `auto_trade:zone_reconcile_aborted:{symbol}` — instead of letting a
  runaway cascade strip the map further. Added `auto_trade:zone_dropped:
  {symbol}` alongside the existing `auto_trade:zone_reconciled:{symbol}`
  counter, and a debug/info summary log line per call
  (`zone reconcile: in=.. trimmed=.. dropped=.. out=..`). Mitigated live via
  `AUTO_TRADE_ZONE_RECONCILE_ENABLED=false`; this PR ships with the flag
  still `false` and re-enabling is a separate follow-up step.
- Fixed range-scalp stops being placed inside the sweep wick, including an
  explicit `stop_exceeds_envelope_after_wick` rejection and counter when the
  safe stop cannot fit the configured risk envelope.
- Fixed duplicate `/algo` TP accounting and announcements: the engine owns
  broker TP fills and booked percentages, while the watcher only reports
  subsequent runner extension until the position closes.

- Box-scalp (both the private gate's own candidates and the scanner-bridge
  `Range Edge Scalp` match, labeled "Range Box Scalp") no longer fires
  outside the `chop` regime. This mean-reversion mutual-exclusion guard
  existed when the regime classifier first shipped but was silently dropped
  once scanner strategy-match selection landed ("private strategies select
  the higher-confluence match instead of using a regime label as a global
  veto"), so a box-labeled trade could fire straight into an active trend.
  Fixes a 22 Jul incident where a Range Edge Scalp BUY filled at the bottom
  of a sharp post-rally pullback and was stopped within a minute. Other
  scanner strategies (Box Breakout, Liquidity Sweep, Mapped Zone Reaction)
  are trend/breakout-appropriate by design and stay ungated. `/auto_status`
  telemetry (`selected_strategy`) now agrees with what actually publishes.
- Added an opposing-barrier veto (`AUTO_TRADE_OPPOSING_BARRIER_VETO_ENABLED`)
  for HTF supply/demand zones and round-number/reaction key levels sitting
  just ahead of an entry, and wired it into `_publish_strategy_match` (the
  scanner-bridge path), which previously had no opposing-zone check of any
  kind — the existing `AUTO_TRADE_HTF_VETO_ENABLED` check only protects the
  zone a trade retests *from*, not what could cap the move ahead of it.
  Fixes a 22 Jul incident where a Box Breakout BUY filled straight into an
  untested round-number supply level with nothing checking for it.
- Connected structural Market Map zones to an executable `Mapped Zone
  Reaction` strategy: Algo now evaluates M1 touches/rejections with
  M5/M15/M30 context instead of showing a valid map level while producing no
  strategy candidate. Round-number display fallbacks remain non-executable.
- Reworked `/auto_status` around strategy selection: it no longer labels the
  private Range Box strategy as a global gate, and now shows the selected
  strategy/source, scanner M5 result, private-strategy states, execution state,
  and current regime explicitly as telemetry only.
- Fixed `Range Edge Scalp` being modeled as a confirmation regime that could
  suppress otherwise valid scanner strategies. It is now one executable
  strategy alongside the other detector matches.

- Re-anchored the equity sizing table to `$200-$900 -> 0.02-0.06`,
  `$1,000-$2,000 -> 0.09-0.15`, and `$3,000-$5,000 -> 0.25-0.30`, holding
  `0.06` and `0.15` across the intervening gaps with intentional jumps at
  `$1,000` and `$3,000`; sizing selection is now explicit through
  `AUTO_TRADE_SIZING_MODE`, whose code default preserves the previous `min`
  behavior while deployment uses `table`.
- Enabled deployment zone-fill laddering with a `0.09`-lot minimum guard;
  smaller plans record the reason and use the existing single-entry path.
  Deployment keeps the recently raised `BE+6` buffer.
- At a `$2,072.02` balance and 65-pip stop, deployment table sizing changes
  per-trade risk from about `$39` (`1.9%`) to `$97.50` (`4.7%`). P&L across the
  eventual deploy timestamp is therefore not directly comparable; record that
  timestamp when this release reaches the VPS.
- Deployment configuration now protects positions at `BE+6` pips instead of
  `BE+3`; the engine's code fallback remains unchanged.
- cTrader token state now persists access-token expiry, reports its serving
  tier at startup, and requires `--yes-i-know` before token-cache reset.
- Auto-trade pip size is now configuration-owned (`0.1` for XAUUSD) instead of
  broker-derived, with a startup invariant across pip size, 100 oz contract
  size, and pip value per lot; the trend-stop maximum is now 65 pips to match
  the existing 6.5-price risk envelope.
- Switched the demo auto-trade account from Fusion Markets to FP Markets;
  `AUTO_TRADE_EXPECTED_BROKER` default moved from `Fusion` to `fpmarkets`
  (matches the `fpmarketssc` broker string cTrader reports). Credentials
  rotated in the deploy vault, not in this repo. Also switched the
  `/auto_status` and event-card icon from ⚡ to 🤖 for ApexVoid Algo.
- Scale-in/pyramiding is now restricted to the trend regime; an add
  candidate whose `regime` is not `"trend"` is rejected before the
  existing scale-in trigger checks run.
- Range-box candidates now require flat XAU exposure, bypass scale-in and
  planned zone-fill, and use one broker-valid 100% target; legacy executor
  target plans remain unchanged.
- Removed the six-trade daily ceiling from ApexVoid Algo; qualified box cycles
  remain unlimited until box invalidation or another safety gate blocks entry.
- Initial and add sizing now use `min(risk-based, equity-table)` from realised
  balance; the single-position guard is now a lifetime tranche-count limit,
  and initial/add stops share the same 15-65 pip structure-stop planner.
- Auto-trade trailing now holds the existing stop after TP2, moves it to TP1
  only after TP3, and moves it to TP2 after TP4 so the runner is not tightened
  one target too early.
- Auto-trade position size now follows the operator-defined balance schedule
  from `$200 -> 0.02` through `$5,000 -> 0.30`, floored to `0.01` lots.
  Low-volume plans close `0.02` at TP1/TP3, `0.03` through TP3, and `0.04`
  through TP4 instead of rejecting every position below five volume steps.
- Auto-trade configuration failures now disable only the executor for the
  current process, while distinct transient failures may retry on the next feed
  session and all startup faults publish a deduplicated operator event.
- Replaced scanner-fed auto entries with an independent `Auto Range Scalp`
  gate: M5/M15 build role-aware rails, M1 confirms rejection, active adverse M5
  momentum is blocked, entry drift is capped at 10 pips, and the nearest
  opposite-role rail must leave at least 30 pips of room.
- Added a broker-valid `0.08`-lot tier for demo balances from `$500` to `$999`,
  so a drawdown below `$1,000` does not permanently disable the executor.
- Increased two-sided range-scalp sensitivity with a longer local window,
  two-touch scored barriers, wider entry tolerance, and strict wick-rejection
  confirmation as an alternative to micro-CHoCH.

- Shared the conservative `rr_entry` and `pips_between` trade-math convention
  between entry cards and watcher accounting; SL/TP alerts now distinguish the
  booked fill from a materially farther bar extreme.
- Label Market Map SCALP rails as explicit `🟢 BUY` or `🔴 SELL` actions instead
  of positional arrows, including scanner-alert rail references.
- Evaluate automatic Market Maps once per configurable 60-minute bucket instead
  of only at session boundaries; materially unchanged boards remain suppressed.
- Restrict actionable SCALP output to the validated `ScalpRange` support and
  resistance pair; internal micro swings, round numbers, and standalone
  trendlines no longer receive misleading `BUY`/`SELL` labels.
- Reorganized `webhook/app/` from a flat module layout into `core/`,
  `persistence/`, `bot/`, `signals/`, `analysis/`, and `autotrade/`
  subpackages with no runtime behavior change; also fixed stale repo-name
  and branch references in the docs and swapped the SQLite-era backup
  procedure for a Postgres `pg_dump`/`psql` one.
- Renamed `webhook/` to `telegram-bot/` (it hasn't hosted a webhook since the
  bot moved to long-polling) and `ctrader-feed/` to `ctrader-engine/` (it has
  always run both the market-data feed and demo auto-trade execution off one
  cTrader session, not just a feed). Directory names, the compose service
  key, and CI build contexts moved.
- Renamed the published `apexvoid-ctrader-feed` Docker Hub image/container to
  `apexvoid-ctrader-engine` to match. The next deploy's `docker compose up
  --remove-orphans` (run by `ansible-library`'s `deploy_image` role) removes
  the old `apexvoid-ctrader-feed` container automatically since the compose
  project name is unchanged and only the service key moved — no manual VPS
  cleanup needed. `ansible-library`/`action-library` were checked: both are
  fully parameterized by this repo's own templates and needed no changes,
  aside from a stale `ctrader-feed` mention in a comment.
  `apexvoid-trading-bot` (the Telegram bot image) is unchanged.

### Fixed

- Watcher TP alerts now always book the configured TP level even when a candle
  opens or runs far beyond it; ApexVoid Algo reply cards no longer expose
  broker position IDs, and full-TP cards include the realized trade result
  without a duplicate technical group-result reply.
- Block false market-chased box breakouts unless closed M1 bars are continuous,
  the break receives a directional edge retest, and at least 35 pips remain to
  the nearest pre-break M1/M5/M15 barrier; nearby barriers now join the target
  ladder instead of being skipped in favor of distant levels. Room and targets
  are measured from the fresh execution spot rather than the prior bar close.
- Disable trend-continuation chase entries by default; the auto-scalp engine
  now waits for a pullback to the broken level before considering execution.
- Dedicated signal-bot scanner and auto-trade events now remain owner-DM-only;
  `SIGNAL_PUBLIC_CHANNEL_ID` is reserved for manual general-bot broadcasts.
- Auto-trade Telegram cursors now advance only after owner delivery succeeds,
  preventing transient DM failures from silently dropping an event.

- Fixed a 10x pip-unit mismatch that blocked every auto-trade candidate on FP
  Markets (`pipPosition=2`); brokers reporting `pipPosition=1` were unaffected.
- Startup recovery from a rejected cTrader access token no longer sends a
  duplicate account-authorization request after refresh already authorized the
  channel, avoiding the `ALREADY_LOGGED_IN` reconnect loop.
- cTrader token rotation now re-authorizes the configured trading account with
  the new access token before releasing the request lock; reconcile retries one
  lost-account-auth response, and refresh failures force a clean feed reconnect.
- Auto-trade session cleanup is now serialized with spot processing so a queued
  tick cannot race `_client` teardown and emit a secondary "session is not
  connected" fault.
- Fixed scale-in sizing that ignored the equity-table exposure ceiling and a
  worst-case rule that blocked valid adds; banked profit and trailed stops now
  contribute to a hard group loss-ceiling headroom without using floating
  equity.
- Cached cTrader refresh tokens no longer shadow a newly authorized `.env`
  token, which previously preserved stale account grants across restarts.
- Auto-trade startup and spot-processing faults no longer cancel the shared
  market-data session or trap the feed in a reconnect loop with no bars.
- Untyped Telegram forming cards and rendered Market Maps cannot create or
  suppress Algo candidates; scanner execution now uses only the explicit typed
  strategy-match contract, while the private worker remains independent.
- Auto Trader quote-gate failures such as stale prices, excessive spread, or
  entry drift now terminate the candidate and advance its Redis cursor instead
  of retrying the same candidate and spamming repeated owner error messages.
- Unexpected Auto Trader candidate failures now use a bounded retry delay and
  emit at most one owner error per candidate while recovery is attempted.
- Watcher SL accounting now treats fills anywhere inside the entry zone as
  breakeven, preserves signed profit for trailed stops, and only books a loss
  when the actual stop fill lands beyond the losing side of the zone.
- `watcher`: price ordinary SL/TP hits at the configured level instead of the
  bar extreme, while preserving honest open-gap fills; this removes inflated
  losses/profits and the midpoint-entry mismatch with the published card.
- Updated the reusable deploy-workflow reference and container source metadata
  for the GitHub username change to `st-mich43l`.
- Manual-signal setup tags are no longer silently dropped when written without
  the literal `/ setup` prefix, including slashless human-entered tags.
- Market Map: reject weak or ATR-distant zones, prevent key levels/trendlines
  from widening entry bands, and compact noisy tags in the owner render.
- Market Map: cap merged band width, remove same-side render overlap, deduplicate
  tags case-insensitively, and require genuine HTF confluence for MAJOR tiers.
- Route on-demand and session-open Market Maps through the dedicated scanner
  bot instead of the general signal-management bot.
- Register and poll owner-only `/trade_map` on the dedicated signal bot while
  retaining the same command on the general bot.
- Give the dedicated signal bot the same `/start` welcome and public
  channel/Knowledge Base links as the general bot.
- `ctrader-feed`: stamp live closed-bar close from the last in-period spot bid,
  with range clamping and an authoritative historical fallback when no spot is
  available; live trendbars without `deltaClose` no longer persist
  `close == low` and poison scanner structure/regime analysis.
- `ctrader-feed`: perform a full-window historical upsert on startup so every
  deployment repairs previously poisoned Redis bars; reconnect backfill remains
  incremental.
- `ctrader-feed`: warn when consecutive live bars keep closing at the same range
  extreme, controlled by `BAR_QUALITY_LOOKBACK` (default `6`).
- `watcher`: count a SELL whole-price TP as hit as soon as price enters that
  handle (for example, `4017.xx` now reaches TP `4017`).
- `watcher`: attach the owner Close/partial-close button to VIP SL-hit alerts
  and book those closes with negative pips instead of TP-style profit pips.

## 2026-07-15

This baseline summarizes the production changes merged from 2026-07-10 through
2026-07-15.

### Added

- Added the in-repo cTrader Open API feed service with Redis OHLC and live spot
  ingestion, health reporting, token refresh persistence, and deployment
  wiring.
- Added the notify-only price-action scanner and its analysis toolkit, including
  market structure, dealing ranges, session levels, liquidity sweeps, zone
  scoring, and multi-timeframe context.
- Added chop-regime detection and the WAIT protocol: trend-continuation setups
  are muted in chop, while grade-A edge fades remain eligible.
- Added setup-agnostic zone-band deduplication to prevent different detectors
  from repeatedly alerting the same trade idea.
- Added a dedicated Telegram token option for scanner notifications.
- Added a public `/start` welcome message linking to `@apexvoidtrading` and the
  trading knowledge base.
- Added automatic daily cancellation of pending orders that were not filled on
  their signal day.

### Changed

- Improved scanner alert quality with tighter reachability, correct-side,
  freshness, zone-width, overlap, and confluence checks.
- Added session-range sweeps and zone-quality scoring to scanner setup ranking.
- Polished weekly performance recap output and removed obsolete WAE scanner
  gates.
- Capped chop-fade TP guidance at the opposite edge of the active range.

### Fixed

- Fixed cTrader trendbar and spot-price scaling before values are written to
  Redis.
- Added a spot plausibility guard so missing, non-finite, non-positive, or
  mis-scaled live prices fall back to the execution-timeframe close instead of
  silencing detection.
- Fixed cTrader feed subscription diagnostics, liveness reporting, and refresh
  token persistence.
- Fixed scanner silence when owner notifications are disabled by keeping the
  analysis status path active.
