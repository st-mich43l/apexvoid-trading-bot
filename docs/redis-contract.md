# Redis market-data contract

Redis is ApexVoid's authoritative **operational market-data plane**, shared by
`ctrader-engine`, Analysis Engine, the Python price-action scanner, and future
dashboards. PostgreSQL remains the durable trade/accounting store. Kafka is
reserved for durable business events and commands, never the bar/tick feed;
see [ADR-010](adr/010-redis-market-data-kafka-events.md).

## Series Key

One sorted set per `(symbol, timeframe)`:

```text
bars:{symbol}:{tf}
```

Examples:

```text
bars:XAU:M5
bars:XAU:M15
bars:XAU:M30
```

## ZSET Member

Score is the UTC bar-open epoch seconds. Member is compact JSON:

```json
{"t":4102444800,"o":4100.12,"h":4104.2,"l":4098.5,"c":4101.7,"v":1234}
```

Fields:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `t` | UTC bar-open epoch seconds |
| `o` | open price |
| `h` | high price |
| `l` | low price |
| `c` | close price |
| `v` | tick volume |

Only closed bars are written. Forming bars must never enter Redis.

For bars finalized from the live cTrader stream, `o`, `h`, and `l` come from
the live trendbar. Because live trendbars may omit `deltaClose`, `c` is stamped
from the last spot bid observed inside that period and clamped to `[l, h]`. If
the period has no spot, the feed fetches that single historical bar before
writing. Startup always upserts the full configured historical window, allowing
deployments to repair stale or malformed cached bars. Historical repair upserts
do not publish `bars:new` replay events.

## Write Semantics

For a closed bar:

```text
ZREMRANGEBYSCORE bars:XAU:M5 <ts> <ts>
ZADD bars:XAU:M5 <ts> <bar_json>
ZREMRANGEBYRANK bars:XAU:M5 0 -(N+1)
PUBLISH bars:new "XAU:M5:<ts>"
```

Removing by score before `ZADD` guarantees exactly one member per timestamp,
even when backfill overlaps reconnect delivery. `N` is `BARS_WINDOW_MAX`.
Configuration V3 requires up to 2,000 M1 bars, so the current .NET sink's
global manifest cap is set to **2,000** for every timeframe. The sink does not
yet expose per-timeframe caps; it intentionally over-retains H4/D1 rather than
under-retaining the analysis bootstrap window.

## Read Semantics

Consumers read the latest window:

```text
ZREVRANGE bars:XAU:M5 0 <k-1>
```

The returned members are newest-first. Consumers that need chronological
analysis should reverse the window locally.

## Pub/Sub Trigger

Channel:

```text
bars:new
```

Payload:

```text
{symbol}:{tf}:{ts}
```

Example:

```text
XAU:M5:4102444800
```

The publish is a cadence signal only: "new data may exist; re-read Redis".
The ZSET is the material data source. Consumers must not treat pub/sub as
durable. Analysis Engine subscribes before its bootstrap scan, keeps a cursor
per symbol/timeframe, reads every bar newer than that cursor chronologically,
and periodically reconciles the ZSET. A missed notification can delay work;
it cannot create a permanent candle gap.

## Live Spot Key

`ctrader-engine` also writes the latest bid/ask spot as a plain Redis string,
throttled to at least one second between writes per symbol:

```text
SET price:XAU:spot {"bid":4082.10,"ask":4082.30,"ts":4102444800}
```

`ts` is UTC epoch seconds when the spot was observed by the feed. Consumers
must treat this as live only while fresh; the scanner falls back to the closed
bar price when it is absent or stale.

## Persistence

Redis is allowed to lose this data on restart. `ctrader-engine` backfills the
configured window from cTrader on startup or reconnect. Deep historical
backtesting storage is a separate future sink, not this Redis contract.

## Auto-Trade Candidate Stream

All fields ending in `*_pips` that cross Redis between the Python gate and the
C# engine are denominated in **0.1 price units for XAUUSD**, independent of the
broker-reported `pipPosition`. Python resolves that unit from its shared
auto-trade units module and C# from `AUTO_TRADE_XAU_PIP_SIZE`; broker metadata is
diagnostic only and must never drive price-to-pip conversion.

When enabled, the Algo worker appends private strategy candidates and completed
scanner strategy matches to:

```text
XADD auto_trade:candidates MAXLEN ~ 1000 * payload <json>
```

The private strategies read raw `bars:XAU:M1`, `bars:XAU:M5`,
`bars:XAU:M15`, and `price:XAU:spot` data. The scanner bridge reads a
short-lived typed match from `auto_trade:strategy_match:{symbol}` (primary)
and the multi-match list from `auto_trade:strategy_matches:{symbol}`. It never
parses Telegram text. Scanner detectors already decide which strategy matches;
the worker does not reclassify it by regime or demand another setup
confirmation. When a confirmed reaction has already left its entry zone, the
worker may require a fresh, episode-scoped M1 timing trigger on a later retest.
Candidate payloads include `tier`, `risk_multiplier`, `family`, and
`range_state` for observability.

Generic scanner matches become `auto_strategy_match` v4 candidates with their
detector setup name, M5 source, structure stop context, and target ladder.
`Range Edge Scalp` remains one strategy and uses the existing
`auto_box_scalp` v3 candidate with stable range bounds and one 50- or 70-pip
full-position target. Publishing fails closed when the spot is absent/stale,
structure-stop context is unavailable, or a high-impact event is guarded.
Candidate claims and outcomes use `auto_trade:executor:candidate:{id}` for
restart-safe idempotency; the stream cursor is `auto_trade:cursor`. Raw
Telegram cards and legacy untyped scanner payloads are never accepted for
execution.

The strategy-match contract has its own version and TTL:

```text
SETEX auto_trade:strategy_match:XAU 420 <json>
```

It contains a stable `match_id`, detector strategy/mode, direction, entry zone,
ATR, structure swing, targets, reasons, and source timestamp. Range-specific
bounds exist only for `Range Edge Scalp`. Invalid, stale, symbol-mismatched, or
malformed matches are removed or ignored. A fresh scanner match has priority
over private strategies for that execution tick.

Mapped-zone execution exposes its evaluated geometry separately:

```text
SETEX auto_trade:map_strategy:actionable:XAU 3600 <json-array>
INCRBY auto_trade:map_zone_rejected:XAU:degenerate_width <count>
```

The snapshot is replaced on every M1 evaluation and contains only the exact
side/lo/hi/tier/score/contains-price entries surviving the strategy's current
side, quality, and minimum-width rules. The counter records collapsed bands
filtered before selection. `auto_trade:market_map_display:XAU` keeps the last
map actually rendered to the owner so stall reasons can identify a display/
strategy divergence.

Used box edges are disarmed until a closed M1 price crosses the box midpoint.
Confirmed broken box IDs are retired for the configured TTL. The latest
operator-facing M1 gate decision is stored at
`auto_trade:last_gate` and `auto_trade:last_gate:{symbol}`. It contains the gate
state, M1 trigger, selected role-aware rail, opposite target, target room, spot
freshness, loaded frame counts, `gate_source`, and active strategy-match
metadata; it is telemetry, not an execution input.

## Auto-Trade State And Events

Open executor state is stored at `auto_trade:position:{position_id}`, with the
tracked IDs in the `auto_trade:positions` set. This holds initial/remaining
native volume, the position-specific broker-valid weighted slices and targets,
their original TP ordinals, target progress, direction, fill, and latest managed
stop. It allows cTrader reconciliation to resume partial TPs and monotonic
trailing after restart while
preserving legacy plans encoded in existing position comments, and removes
state for positions closed by broker SL or manually.

UTC daily entry counts use `auto_trade:daily:{yyyyMMdd}:trades`. The owner kill
switch is `auto_trade:paused`; `1` blocks new entries but does not stop existing
position management.

Executor lifecycle events are appended as JSON payloads to
`auto_trade:events`. The Python bot persists its delivery cursor at
`auto_trade:telegram_event_cursor`. Open and target events carry their own
initial `stop_pips`; open events also carry the broker-valid `targets_pips`
ladder used by that position, so delivery never reconstructs risk from a
global default.

Scanner-confirmed reaction execution timing is persisted independently from
the setup lifecycle:

```text
SETEX auto_trade:execution_confirmation:{setup_id} <ttl> <json>
```

The JSON records `phase`, deterministic `episode_id`, zone entry/exit
timestamps, the last evaluated closed M1 timestamp, and consumed trigger
evidence. Phases cover immediate M5 authority, waiting for a retest, waiting
for an in-zone M1 trigger, trigger acceptance/miss, publication, expiry, and
invalidation. TTL is at least the setup lifecycle retention. BUY membership
uses executable ask and SELL membership uses executable bid; midpoint is never
execution evidence. This key is Python-owned restart state and is not consumed
by Telegram or used by C# for price-action analysis.

The dedicated signal bot sends full operational cards only to the configured
owner DM. `SIGNAL_PUBLIC_CHANNEL_ID` remains exclusively for manual broadcasts
from the general bot. Order message IDs are cached for seven days under
`auto_trade:msg:{position_id}` (plus group namespaces) so TP, stop, close, and
scale-in updates reply to their trade root. A missing or rejected Telegram
reply target falls back to a standalone card.

## TradePlan Stream (execution:*)

Deliberately a separate namespace from `auto_trade:*` above - see
`docs/adr-trade-plan-v8-cutover.md`. A TradePlan must never be
reinterpreted as a V6 `TradeCandidate` or vice versa, so the two contracts
never share a key prefix or a stream.

```text
execution:trade_plans              XADD stream of published TradePlan V8 JSON
execution:plan:{plan_id}           Python plan JSON, short TTL from plan expiry
execution:plan_dedup:{plan_id}     publication tombstone, seven-day default TTL
execution:plan_state:{plan_id}     monotonic mechanical state
execution:plan_claim:{plan_id}     executor claim, 24-hour TTL
execution:plan_runtime:{plan_id}   C# open runtime state
execution:plan_recovery:{plan_id}  C# recovery copy while runtime state is open
execution:plan_ack:{plan_id}       latest structured executor acknowledgement
execution:plan_rejection:{id}      durable malformed/unsupported stream record
execution:trade_plan_runtime_ids   tracked C# runtime plan IDs
execution:trade_plan_cursor        last durably handled stream ID
```

Python atomically checks/sets the dedup tombstone, writes the short-lived plan
payload and `published` state, then appends exactly one stream entry. The
tombstone TTL is `max(24h, AUTO_TRADE_CANDIDATE_STORAGE_TTL_SECONDS)`, seven
days by default, so deleting or expiring the payload cannot re-publish the same
deterministic plan ID. Existing pre-tombstone payloads are backfilled on retry.

C# reads after its durable cursor. A valid plan is source-generated JSON
deserialized, validated, claimed, persisted as runtime/recovery state, and
marked `armed` before the cursor advances. A malformed plan is stored under
`execution:plan_rejection:{stream_id}` and publishes `plan_rejected` before
the cursor advances. A transient Redis or broker error leaves the cursor
unchanged for retry. Duplicate claims reconcile the existing state and never
submit another order.

The scalar plan state is the cross-language lifecycle projection:
`published`, `received`, `armed`, `submitted`, `filled`, `managing`,
`completed`, `rejected`, `cancelled`, or `expired`. The acknowledgement key
adds executor timestamp, stream ID, executor label, and optional reason code.
C# recovery payloads use their own key so they do not extend Python's plan
payload TTL. Recovery/runtime keys are removed when execution becomes terminal.
