"""P0-10: one-shot startup reconciliation for Redis state left over from
before this branch's invariants existed - an active record with no
expiry-index entry (created before setup_lifecycle._save started syncing
one), an orphaned forming card whose setup already expired or vanished, a
forming-status snapshot with no card left to apply it to, or a terminal
setup whose route_outcome snapshot was never corrected. Runs once at
process start (see main.py), before the continuous sweeper's own first
pass - a migration/rollout safety net, not a replacement for it.

Every scan uses SCAN (never KEYS, never blocks Redis for the duration of
the pass), every write is idempotent, and nothing is ever deleted unless
it can be positively identified as orphaned against the canonical
setup_lifecycle record. No Redis FLUSH of any kind.
