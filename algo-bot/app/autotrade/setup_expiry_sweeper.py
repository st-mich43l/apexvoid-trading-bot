"""P0-2: durable, restart-safe expiry sweep.

Reads analysis:setup_expiry (a ZSET kept in sync by setup_lifecycle._save
on every write - see setup_lifecycle.py's _sync_expiry_index) and drives
any setup whose score (expires_at) has passed into EXPIRED, using
expire_setup for the state transition and finalize_terminal_setup for
cleanup. This never relies on Redis key TTL as the expiry signal, and it
never depends on a future bar, Telegram delivery, or a ready-stream event
arriving to notice the expiry - the whole point of P0-1/P0-2 is that a
setup nobody ever touches again still gets closed out.

Multi-worker-safe: every step here is either idempotent (expire_setup,
finalize_terminal_setup) or a plain ZREM, so two sweepers racing on the
same batch just do harmless duplicate work - there is no in-memory state
that would diverge between workers, and a restart loses nothing (the
index plus the canonical records are the only source of truth for what's
due).
