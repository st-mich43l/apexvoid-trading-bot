"""P0-9: one coordinator for everything that must happen when a setup
reaches a terminal state (EXPIRED/INVALIDATED/CANCELLED/CONSUMED).

Every path that can produce a terminal setup_lifecycle transition (the
expiry sweeper, scanner invalidation, worker rejection paths) should call
this instead of hand-rolling its own cleanup, so no single call site can
forget a step and leave an orphan Telegram card, a stale route-outcome
snapshot, or a stuck reconciliation marker behind.

Coverage note (explicit, not silently claimed complete): this coordinator
clears the Telegram forming card, the reconciliation-pending marker, the
execution-confirmation transient key, the analysis:setup_expiry index
membership, the route-outcome terminal snapshot, the active-thesis claim,
and emits the terminal lifecycle event. It does NOT release a held
confluence-zone claim, ready-event recovery state, or remove a stale
StrategyMatch from scanner-side active collections:
- The confluence-zone claim key is derived at claim time from
  (symbol, match, market_map) via _resolve_match_confluence_claim_id
  (worker.py) - it is never persisted onto the canonical SetupRecord, so a
  setup_id-only coordinator has no way to recompute which zone_id to
  release without either a schema change or a reverse-lookup key that
  does not exist today. The active-thesis claim IS releasable here
  because SetupRecord already carries symbol/thesis_id directly.
- Ready-event recovery state and stale StrategyMatch removal need the
  specific StrategyMatch/market-map context call sites that already hold
  it, not a setup_id alone.
Callers that hold that context should still release it themselves after
calling this - see worker.py's own _release_claims() at the point a
confluence-zone claim is taken, which already does this correctly for
that one call site.
