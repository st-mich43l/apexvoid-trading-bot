"""Setup lifecycle state machine for TradePlan V8 analysis (Phase 2).

This is a distinct state machine from `app/autotrade/lifecycle.py`'s
`LIFECYCLE_STATES`, which tracks V6 execution progress
(order_planned/order_submitted/managing/...). This module tracks the
*analysis* side: whether a structural reaction is still being watched,
forming, confirmed, or has produced a plan. A CONFIRMED setup publishes
directly to PLAN_BUILT when its executable quote is inside the entry
contract; otherwise it remains CONFIRMED while waiting for retest. The C#
executor stays mechanical.

Storage: `analysis:setup:{setup_id}` (see docs/redis-contract.md).

# P0-1: business expiry (the setup's own expires_at) must never be conflated
# with Redis key TTL (data retention). Before this, _ttl_for set the key's
# TTL to roughly expires_at-now - once nothing touched the record again
# after the setup silently passed its business expiry, Redis could delete
# the canonical record at almost exactly the moment it should have
# transitioned to EXPIRED, with no terminal lifecycle event, no card
# deletion, and no audit trail. These two constants keep the record
# readable well past both business expiry and terminal transition.
#
# 2026-09: a 24h floor was still far too short for an ACTIVE (non-terminal)
# record - it re-anchors from whichever save last touched it, not from
# activation, so a position that fills and then sees no further event for
# >24h (a normal weekend: fill Friday, market closed until Sunday night)
# has this record silently expire while the position is still genuinely
# open. Startup reconciliation (_reconcile_forming_cards) then reads
# load_setup() as None and deletes the still-needed forming-card Telegram
# mapping, so the next real event (order_filled / position_closed) can't
# find the original card and creates a duplicate instead - confirmed live
# on a USDJPY position that crossed a weekend. 30 days safely outlives any
# realistic single gap (weekend, holiday closure) between events for a
# still-open position; TERMINAL is a pure audit window with no functional
