"""SetupExecutionAggregate: one authoritative read across the three canonical
execution stores (P0 spec).

`analysis:setup:{setup_id}` (business state), `auto_trade:execution_confirmation:
{setup_id}` (execution timing) and `execution:plan_state:{plan_id}`
(publication) can each lag the others by one write - a projection writer
(Telegram card, route outcome) that trusts only its own local return value can
show a status one step behind what actually happened. This module is the
single place that reconciles all three into one effective answer.
